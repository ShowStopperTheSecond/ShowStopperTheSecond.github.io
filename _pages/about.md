Greetings! I'm Javid Norouzi, a tech enthusiast hailing from Afghanistan, currently calling Shiraz, Iran, my home. With a Master's in Telecommunication Engineering, specializing in Signal Processing and Computer Vision, my journey has been fueled by an insatiable curiosity for technology.

As a child, the profound impact of the internet and telecommunications on human lives inspired my academic path. Today, my focus has shifted to artificial intelligence (AI), a realm I believe holds unparalleled potential to propel us into uncharted territories of knowledge.

Beyond academia, you'll find me immersed in diverse interests — from indulging in anime and books to navigating the intricate moves of a chessboard. The world of computers, with its perpetual learning curve, captivates me endlessly. Currently, I'm sharpening my web development skills, driven by a compass of personal growth and progress.

Despite being between professional endeavors, my passion for problem-solving remains steadfast. Proficient in various programming languages and algorithms, my forte lies in computer vision, where I've honed my skills in manipulating digital images.


Looking ahead, my aspirations coalesce into a clear vision — a Ph.D. in AI, a stepping stone toward a mission of using technology to enhance human well-being. My mission is clear: to contribute to a healthier, longer, and happier life for all. In the near future, you'll find me embarking on this academic pursuit.

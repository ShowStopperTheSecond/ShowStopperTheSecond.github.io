Selected Projects
======
* Lactic Acid Threshold Detection via Breathing Pattern
  * <small>Developed a method to identify the ventilatory threshold using audio-recorded breathing signals. This technique is particularly valuable in fitness and training applications, enabling athletes to determine if they have reached their optimal workout intensity. </small>


* Quadratic Mirror Filter Bank Demo
  * <small>A graphical interface for applying filters to discrete signals in real time in C++. A quadratic mirror filter bank wasused, and the graphical interface was implemented using Qt and QML. This project was a part of the ADSP course. github.com/ShowStopperTheSecond/QMFB </small>

* Finger Print Verification on Low-quality Images
  * <small>Enhancing fingerprint ridges on different angles to help better verification of low-quality fingerprint images. This was part of the Digital Image Processing course. github.com/ShowStopperTheSecond/FingerPringRidges</small>

* Image WaterMarking By Using Pseudo Random Sequences
  * <small>Hiding a watermark in digital art imagery to track their ownership with the minimum loss in quality. This was part of the image watermarking course. github.com/ShowStopperTheSecond/imgWaterMarking</small>

* Presence Logger
  * <small>A presence logger using Arduino and fingerprint sensors. The designed logger could record the entry and departure times of employees. This was the summer internship project I took at TechVico, a startup to create smart wheelchairs for disabled patients.</small>

* 5G Antenna
  * <small>The final bachelor project involving the design of a 5G antenna using the High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS). The designed antenna could show a good gain in the 5G frequency band.</small>

Honors and Awards
====
  * <small> Ranked 3rd among graduate master students of System Telecommunications (Shiraz, Iran, 2022)

  * <small> The 1st team IPCC(International Programming Collegiate Contest) at the University of Birjand (Birjand, Iran, 2018)

  * <small> The 1st team IPCC(International Programming Collegiate Contest) at the University of Birjand (Birjand, Iran, 2017)

  * <small> The 1st place in programming competitions under 15 years old in Shiraz district, 1 (Shiraz, Iran, 2009)

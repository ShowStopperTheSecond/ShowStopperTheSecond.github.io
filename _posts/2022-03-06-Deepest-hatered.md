"I cannot forgive your eyes that saw Faputa and her siblings as nothing more than appetizing. Your mouths that use the same words and  prayers as  mother, Those mouths I cannot forgive. I cannot forgive your shapes that continue to blaspheme mother with your being. Your lives that continue to exist, I cannot forgive.

Your intentions, I cannot forgive. Nor your joy, nor your grief, nor your deeds. I absolutely will not allow them to continue. Until you're all reduced to ashes, I cannot permiss your existence. Everything I was born not to forget, for this day, for this moment. How I tired of waiting. The time I have waited also cannot be forgiven. I will exterminate all of you."

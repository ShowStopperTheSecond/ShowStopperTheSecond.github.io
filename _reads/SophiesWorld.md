"Sophie's World" is a Norwegian philosophical novel by Jostein Gaarder. It follows a 14-year-old girl named Sophie Amundsen who receives a series of mysterious letters about philosophy. The letters are written by an unknown philosopher who guides Sophie through the history of philosophy, from ancient Greece to the 20th century.

The novel is a blend of fiction and non-fiction, and it covers a wide range of philosophical topics, including metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics. It is also a coming-of-age story, as Sophie learns about herself and the world around her through her philosophical studies.

"Sophie's World" has been praised for its accessibility and its ability to make complex philosophical ideas understandable to a young audience. It has also been criticized for its oversimplification of some concepts and its lack of depth in certain areas. However, it remains a popular book and has been translated into more than 50 languages.

There has been so many amazing things in this book. I can't really chose what to call important. Every single line is worth reading several times. One of the things I really loved was this:

our minds often create these compound things by blending existing concepts or experiences. For example, a dragon might be imagined as a combination of a bird (for flight) and a lizard (for scales).

This idea aligns with the philosophical concept of emergence, where complex properties or behaviors arise from the interactions of simpler components. In the case of mythological creatures, the complex image of a dragon emerges from the combination of simpler elements like birds and lizards. Therefore a dragon doesn't really exist and it's merely a creation of the mind. This is a test to tell real things from fake ones. Of course it's not accurate but It provides a good starting point.

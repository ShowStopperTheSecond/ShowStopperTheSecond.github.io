- I want to cherish each thing I have
as though it alone were all that mattered in the world. But I want every-
thing, and my hands are empty. I envy him. I'm sure he doesn't know
what boredom is."



- "As if malice were ever pure! As if there were pleasure in being mali-
cious. They would never understand, not even Roger could understand.
They were easygoing and insensitive; no bitterness burned in their
hearts. I'm not their kind."


- In times past, she had often
uttered that prayer when deeply distressed. And God heard her, always
agreed with her. At that time she had dreamed of becoming a saint.
She practiced flagellation, and at night slept on a board. But there were
too many chosen ones in Heaven, too many saints. God loved every-
one; she could never be satisfied with such undiscriminating benevo-
lence.



- "If only I were lucky enough to have amnesia!"

- "If I had amnesia, I'd be almost like other men. Perhaps I'd even
be able to love you."


- "He goes to restaurants twice
a day, he wears chain-store suits and he's as boring as an office clerk.
I think lover-cured him."



- You mustn't let three whole days go by without coming to
see me."
"Three days isn't long."
"For me, it's long. Remember, I have nothing else to do but wait for
you."
 
 "That's just where you've made your mistake," she said. "You may
have nothing to do, but I've got a thousand things to keep me busy. 1
can't take up all my days with you from morning till night."


"You asked for it. You wanted me to take notice of you. Now noth-
ing else matters to me. I know you're alive and I feel an emptiness inside
me when you're away."



- "Ah! It's the devil!" Annie exclaimed.
''No, not at all. I just came in through the window, that's all."
Regina stood up. "I'm sorry the window wasn't locked."




- "Can't you talk about anything else?"
"But how can you think of anything else?" he asked. "How on earth
can you feel so permanently settled in the world when you've just
hardly come into it and when you're going to leave it again in so few
years?"



- Why should you think of death when you're going to die
whether you want to or not. It will be so simple for you; you won't
have to bother yourself about it at all.

- I'm alive and yet I'm not living. I'll never die and yet I have
no future. I'm no one. I'm without a past, faceless.




- "I exist for you, at this moment. But do you really exist?"
"Of course," she answered. "And so do you." She grabbed him by
the arm. "Don't you feel my hand on your arm?"
He looked at her hand. "That hand, yes, but what does it mean?"
"It's my hand, that's all," Regina replied.
"Your hand ..." He was silent for a moment. "You have to love me
and I have to love you. Then you'd be there, and I would be where
you are."


- What visions-visions that would
never die-passed through his mind?



- Save me," she pleaded. "Save me from death."
"Ah!" he said fervently. "It's you who must save me!" He took
Regina's face in his hands. He looked at her so intensely that it seemed
as if he wanted to tear her soul from her body. "Save me from the night
and from apathy," he said. "Make me love you and know that you alone
exist among all other women. Then the world will fall back into shape.
There will be tears, smiles, expectations, fears. I'll be a living man
again."


- He closed his eyes again. Beatrice turned around and slowly left
the room. I stayed beside him and for a long while I studied his smooth
cheeks, his fresh eyelids, the face of my beloved son. I had saved him,
but I had not been able to give him the strength to cross the lake.
Perhaps Beatrice was right to cry. vVith a sudden feeling of anguish I
thought, How much longer will he obey me?


- He wanted to mold his life with his own
hands, his untried, awkward hands. \Vas it possible, after all, to shut
that life away in a hothouse and cultivate it free from all dangers?
Stifled, bound, it would soon lose its brightness, its fragrance.


- But how could I give her what she per-
sisted in not asking for.


- I wanted to
believe that she was no different than those ephemeral insects, but she
was just as alive, just as real as I. Her fleeting existence weighed more
heavily upon her than my own destiny upon me.


- He asked for worries; she took pleasure in suffering. vVhat demons
possessed them?


- You kill all desires. You give and give, but you never give
anything but playthings. Maybe that's the reason Antonio chose to die-
because he couldn't really live.


- When Antonio dove into a lake, when he led an attack, I admired
him because he was risking his life. But you, can you ever do anything
courageous? I loved his generosity, and it's true that you give freely
of yourself and your possessions with no thought of your wealth, your
time, your pains. But you have so many millions of lives to live that
you never really sacrifice anything. And 1 loved his pride. He was a man
like any other man, but contrary to most of them, he chose to be him-
self. 1 think there's something beautiful about that. You ... you're an
exceptional being, and you know it. That doesn't move me.


- in the shame of that useless night watch, I had
stopped belonging to myself.


- I could not tell him what 1 was
really thinking: that a life, even the best of lives, weighs no more than
the flight of a gnat, but that the roads, the cities, the canals we could
build, would remain on the surface of the earth throughout eternity;
that for eternity, we could rip a whole continent from the dark
shadows of virgin forests and idiotic superstitions. 1 could not tell him
these things because Charles was unconcerned with an earthly future
he would never see with his own eyes. But 1 did know the words that
were capable of awakening a response in his heart.


- I considered the fervor which he brought to bear in
combatting the Roman superstitions no less stupid than the superstitions
themselves.


- "I cannot,
will not, retract a single word of what I have said or written, for to
act against one's conscience is neither safe nor honest."

I winced. His words struck at me like a challenge. But it was not
only the words; it was the tone in which he spoke them. This man had
the audacity to maintain that his conscience was more important than
the interests of the Empire, indeed, than the interests of the world.

I wanted to gather the universe in my hands and he declared that he
was a universe in himself. His arrogance populated the world with
thousands of stubborn wills. And this, surely, was why the people
and even the sages listened intently to him.

He stirred up that rage of
pride in their hearts which had devoured Antonio and Beatrice. And
if he were permitted to continue his preachings, in time he would have
everyone believing that each man was sole judge of his relations with
God and judge also of his own acts. How then would I ever be able
to make them obey?


He continued to speak, attacking the Church's established dogma.
But I began to see that it was not only dogma, grace, faith that was in
question; something else was at stake: the very works of which I had
so long dreamed. They could be realized only if men were brought
to renounce their self-love, their whims, their follies. And it was pre-
cisely this that the Church taught. She enjoined people to obey one
set of laws, to bow before one faith; and if I were powerful enough,
those laws would be mine. Through the mouths of priests, I could make
God speak in whatever manner I wanted. But if each individual sought
God in his own conscience, I knew it would not be I whom he would
encounter.

"Who has the right to decide?" Balthus had said to me.
That was why they defended Luther-they wanted to decide, each
man for himself. But then the world would be even more divided than
it had ever been before, and it had to be governed by a single will-
mine.

-  How did I dare say to myself one
day while listening to the fountains of Granada, "I gave that man his
life, his happiness"? Now I would have to say, "It was I who gave him
those lifeless eyes, that sad mouth, his shuddering heart. His unhappi-
ness is all my doing." It was cold in his soul and I felt that coldness as
keenly as if I had touched my hand to a corpse.


- The only solution . .. we have no choice . .. nothing else you could
do ... Through the years, the centuries, the mechanism slowly un-
wound itself. Only a fool could believe that the will of a single human
being was able to change its movement. What did our great plans
matter?


- He seemed to be asking himself, "\Vhy not be defeated?" And per-
haps he was right. In spite of everything, there were men whose desires
had left their marks on earth-Luther, Cortez ... Was it because
they had accepted the idea of being defeated?
As for us, we had
chosen victory. And now we were asking ourselves, "What victory?"


- Every two years a
general distribution of wool took place, and in the warmer parts of
the realm, cotton grown on the royal lands, was handed out to all.
Each man was mason and smith as well as cultivator of his allotted
field, and he did everything in his own home that needed to be done.
There were no poor people among them. As I listened to Filipillo, I
thought, That, then, was the empire we destroyed, the empire I
dreamed of establishing on earth and that I did not know how to
build!


- He told me that since the conquest, the songs with which mothers
lulled their babes to sleep were all as sorrowful as the one I had just
heard. Only women and children were left in the village, the men
having been taken away to work in the Potosi mines. And it was thus
in every village and settlement through which we passed all the way
to the volcano.


- From morning till night, trains of mules laden with silver went
down toward the coast. Every ounce of metal had been bought with
an ounce of blood. And yet the emperor's chests remained empty and
his people continued to live in poverty. We had destroyed a world,
and we had destroyed it for nothing.


- But do you believe you can force salvation upon others or can
you seek it only for yourself?


- "With God's grace, only for myself." He brought his hand to his
brow. "I used to think it was my duty to force others to seek salva-
tion, and that was my mistake. It was a temptation placed before me
by the devil."



- "I had a son," I resumed, "and he chose to die because it was the
only choice he could make for himself; I left him nothing eIse to live
for. I had a wife, too, and because I insisted upon giving her every-
thing, she no more lived than if she were dead. And there are those
whom we burned alive and who died thanking us. It's not happiness
they want; they want to live."

"To live? But after all, what does that mean? This life is nothing,"
he said, shaking his head. "What madness to want to dominate a
world that's really nothing!"

- "There are moments when a fire burns in their hearts; that's what
they mean by living."


- "I understand them," I said. "Now I understand them. It's never
what they receive that has value in their eyes; it's what they do. If
they can't create, they must destroy. But in any case, they have to
rebel against what is, otherwise they wouldn't be men. And we who
aspire to forge a world for them and imprison them in it, they can't
help but hate us. The very order, the peace that we dream of for them,
would be their worst possible curse."



- Men can create their own happiness and that of others," said Richet.
I shrugged my shoulders. "They'll never be happy."
"You're wrong. They'll be happy the day they become reasonable,"
he said.
"They don't even want to be happy." I retorted. "They're only too
happy to kill time while waiting for time to kill them. You-all of you
-you're simply killing time by dazzling yourselves with your own
brillia nce."


- But what I liked above all was to witness the combat
of a man against himself.


- He was trying to provoke me. He did not know
I had no honor to defend, no anger to satisfy. And neither was there
anything to stop me from slapping him, beating him, throwing him to
the ground. I was subject to none of their conventions. If they knew
to what degree I was free from them and their inane rules, then they
would have been really frightened of me.



- "A man," I said, "once told me that there is only one good: to act
according to one's conscience. I think he was right and that all we
pretend to do for others is worthless."


- but if you have to guard it so carefully, being healthy is no
longer a good,"


- I gave myself to you completely," she said. "And I believed you had
given yourself completely to me, in life as well as in death. And you
were only lending yourself to me for a few scant years." A sob choked
her voice. "Just another woman among millions. One day you won't
even remember my name. And it will still be you. It will be you and no
one else." She stood up. "No! No! It's not possible!" she cried out.


- "What is your love?" she said scornfully. "When two mortal beings
love each other, that love molds them together body and soul; it's their
very substance. But for you, it's ... it's an accident." She pressed her
hand against her brow. "Oh, God! How alone I am!"



- "You'll live in my heart longer than you'd have lived in the heart of
any mortal man," I said.
"No," she retorted. "If you were mortal, I'd go on living in you
until the end of the world, because your death would be the end of the
world for me. But instead, I'm going to die in a world that will never
end."


- For them living was merely not dying. \Vhat was the
good of struggling for them? They would soon be delivered in any
case; they would die, each in his turn.


- How much longer
would I still be able to hear her voice? And when their smiles and
their tears no longer found an echo in me, what would become of me?


- Why live, if living is merely not dying? But to die in order to save
one's life, is not that the greatest dupery of all?


- I've got to feel that I'm alive, even if I have
to die trying


- \Ve don't have to count on the future to give a meaning to our acts.
If that were the case, all action would be impossible. \Ve have to carry
on our fight the way we decided to carry it on. That's all.



- The stakes were blazing, the wind was scattering the ashes
of the two Augustinian monks. There is only one good: to act accord-
ing to one's conscience. Stretched out on his bed, Antonio was smiling.
They were neither insane nor bloated with pride; I understood them
now. They were men who 'wanted to fulfill their destinies as men by
choosing their own lives and deaths: free men.


- "You should be lead-
ing rather than obeying them."
"But I can't look upon things the same way they do," I said. He
looked at me irritably and I continued, "I can do whatever they ask
me to do. But how can I decide for them? How can I possibly know
what they believe to be good or bad for themselves?"



- What makes you think that a man must prefer the cause he hap-
pens to be serving for the moment to his own destiny? "I can't make any distinction between the two."


- You're already far off in the future," he said. "And you look upon
these moments as if they were part of the past. And all past enterprises
appear derisive when they're seen only as dead, embalmed, and buried.
That Carmona was great and free for two hundred years doesn't move
you much today. But you know very well what Carmona meant to
those who loved her. I don't believe you were wrong in defending her
against Genoa.


- She sank back into the leather chair and stared at her reflection in
the mirror. She was alone, she was weary. She would grow old, alone
and weary, without receiving anything in exchange for the gifts she
lavished and which were not even sought from her, fighting for them,
without them, against them, doubting them and doubting herself. In my
heart, something still trembled-pity.


- Because I wanted nothing for myself with them, there was nothing I
could want for them. I would have had to love her. I did not love her. I
wanted nothing.


- The image of her face was
now snuffed out completely, forever, and in my heart, even the beating
of her heart had stopped. You'll forget me. It was not I who had for-
gotten her. She had slipped out of the world, had slipped out of me who
would never leave this world and yet who did not belong to it.

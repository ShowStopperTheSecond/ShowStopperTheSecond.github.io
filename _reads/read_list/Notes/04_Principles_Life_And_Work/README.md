# The Golden Qoutes:
- We are all born with different thinking abilities but we aren’t born with
decision-making skills.
We learn them from our encounters with reality.


- everyone expects the future to be a slightly
modified version of the present, it is usually very different


- I gradually learned that
prices reflect people’s expectations, so they go up when actual results are
better than expected and they go down when they are worse than expected.
And most people tend to be biased by their recent experiences.


- You better make sense of
what happened to other people in other times and other places because if
you don’t you won’t know if these things can happen to you and, if they do,
you won’t know how to deal with them


- In trading you have to be defensive and aggressive at the same
time. If you are not aggressive, you are not going to make money, and if
you are not defensive, you are not going to keep money.


- There are always risks out there that can
hurt you badly, even in the seemingly safest bets, so it’s always best to
assume you’re missing something. This lesson changed my approach to
decision making in ways that will reverberate throughout this book—and to
which
I
attribute
much
of
my
success.
But
I
would
make
many
other
mistakes before I fully changed my behavior.


- While making money was good, having meaningful work and meaningful
relationships was far better.
To me, meaningful work is being on a mission I
become engrossed in, and meaningful relationships are those I have with
people I care deeply about and who care deeply about me.

- Think about it: It’s senseless to have making money as your goal as
money has no intrinsic value—its value comes from what it can buy, and it
can’t buy everything. It’s smarter to start with what you really want, which
are your real goals, and then work back to what you need to attain them.


- In thinking about the
relative
importance
of
great
relationships
and
money,
it
was
clear
that
relationships were more important because there is no amount of money I
would
take
in
exchange
for
a
meaningful
relationship,
because
there
is
nothing I could buy with that money that would be more valuable


- To give you an idea about how interwoven
they were in my mind, Devon was named after one of the oldest breeds of
cattle known to man, among the first breeds imported into the U.S. and
renowned for its high fertility. (:\ wtf why would you name your son after cattles )


- I learned (again) that no matter how much I knew and how
hard I worked, I could never be certain enough to proclaim things like what
I’d said on Wall $treet Week: “There’ll be no soft landing. I can say that
with absolute certainty, because I know how markets work.” I am still
shocked and embarrassed by how arrogant I was.


- I learned a great fear of being wrong that shifted my mind-
set from thinking “I’m right” to asking myself “How do I know I’m right?”
And I saw clearly that the best way to answer this question is by finding
other independent thinkers who are on the same mission as me and who see
things differently from me. By engaging them in thoughtful disagreement,
I’d be able to understand their reasoning and have them stress-test mine.
That way, we can all raise our probability of being right.
In other words, I just want to be right—I don’t care if the right answer
comes from me. So I learned to be radically open-minded to allow others to
point out what I might be missing. I saw that the only way I could succeed
would be to:
	1. Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to
	understand their reasoning.
	2. Know when not to have an opinion.
	3. Develop, test, and systemize timeless and universal principles.
	4. Balance risks in ways that keep the big upside while reducing the
	downside.


- to build Bridgewater as an idea meritocracy—not an
autocracy in which I lead and others follow, and not a democracy in which
everyone’s
vote
is
equal—but
a
meritocracy
that
encourages
thoughtful
disagreements and explores and weighs people’s opinions in proportion to
their merits.



- I saw that to do exceptionally well you have to push your limits and that,
if you push your limits, you will crash and it will hurt a lot. You will think
you have failed—but that won’t be true unless you give up. Believe it or not,
your pain will fade and you will have many other opportunities ahead of
you, though you might not see them at the time.





- I learned that if you work hard and
creatively, you can have just about anything you want, but not everything
you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to
pursue even better ones.



- I love getting to know interesting people from interesting places and
seeing the world through their eyes. This is true whether they are rich or
poor.


- Encounters like these have taught me that human
greatness
and
terribleness
are
not
correlated
with
wealth
or
other
conventional measures of success. I’ve also learned that judging people
before
really
seeing
things
through
their
eyes
stands
in
the
way
of
understanding their circumstances—and that isn’t smart.



- I had always wanted to have—and to be
around people who also wanted to have—a life full of meaningful work and
meaningful relationships, and to me a meaningful relationship is one that’s
open and honest in a way that lets people be straight with each other. I never
valued
more
traditional,
antiseptic
relationships
where
people
put
on
a
façade of politeness and don’t say what they really think.


- I believe that all organizations basically have two types of people: those
who work to be part of a mission, and those who work for a paycheck


- I fought for what I thought was best, and I
wanted them to do so as well. When I thought someone did something
stupid, I said so and I expected them to tell me when I did something stupid.

- To
me,
that
was
what
strong
and
productive relationships looked like. Operating any other way would be
unproductive and unethical.



- All great investors and investment approaches have bad patches; losing
faith in them at such times is as common a mistake as getting too enamored
of them when they do well. Because most people are more emotional than
logical, they tend to overreact to short-term results; they give up and sell low
when times are bad and buy too high when times are good.


- I have come to realize that
bad times coupled with good reflections provide some of the best lessons,
and not just about business but also about relationships.



- I didn’t value experience as much as character, creativity, and common
sense, which I suppose was related to my having started Bridgewater two
years out of school myself, and my belief that having an ability to figure
things out is more important than having specific knowledge of how to do
something.




- Making
a
handful
of
good
uncorrelated
bets
that
are
balanced and leveraged well is the surest way of having a lot of upside
without being exposed to unacceptable downside.




- I could’ve done something dramatic
like fire Ross to set a tone that mistakes would not be tolerated. But since
mistakes happen all the time, that would have only encouraged other people
to hide theirs, which would have led to even bigger and more costly errors


- Having a process that ensures problems are brought to the surface, and
their root causes diagnosed, assures that continual improvements occur.


- For
that
reason
I
insisted
that
an
issue
log
be
adopted
throughout
Bridgewater. My rule was simple: If something went badly, you had to put it
in the log, characterize its severity, and make clear who was responsible for
it. If a mistake happened and you logged it, you were okay. If you didn’t log
it, you would be in deep trouble.




- They knew that I wanted the best for them and Bridgewater, and to get
that I needed to be radically truthful with them and I needed them to be
radically truthful with me. This wasn’t only because it produced better
results, but also because being truthful with each other was fundamental to
how I believed we should be with each other. We agreed that being this way
was essential, but since it was making some people feel bad, something had
to change.


- 
	1. Put our honest thoughts out on the table,
	2. Have thoughtful disagreements in which people are willing to shift
	their opinions as they learn, and
	3. Have agreed-upon ways of deciding (e.g., voting, having clear
	authorities) if disagreements remain so that we can move beyond them
	without resentments.


- I believe that for any organization or for any relationship to be great,
these things are required. I also believe that for a group decision-making
system to be effective, the people using it have to believe that it’s fair.



- Most people assume that the challenges that go along with growing a
large business are greater than those of growing a smaller one. That is not
true. Going from a five-person organization to a sixty-person organization
was just as challenging as going from a sixty-person organization to a seven-
hundred-person


- I
can’t
say
that
the
challenges were easier or harder at any of the various phases we went
through.
They
were
just
different.



- I recognized that managers
who do not understand people’s different thinking styles cannot understand
how the people working for them will handle different situations, which is
like a foreman not understanding how his equipment will behave. That
insight led us to explore psychometric testing as a way of learning how
people think differently.



- Recently I came across a study that
revealed a cognitive bias in which people consistently overlook the evidence
of one person being better than another at something and assume that both
are equally good at a task. This was exactly what we were seeing.



- To me, the greatest success you can have as the person in charge is to
orchestrate others to do things well without you. A step below that is doing
things well yourself, and worst of all is doing things poorly yourself.


- Getting a lot of attention for being successful is a bad position to be in.
Australians call it the “tall poppy syndrome,” because the tallest poppies in
a field are the ones most likely to have their heads whacked off.



- But starting in the 1990s, I began to recognize the emotional barriers
most people had to looking at their problems and weaknesses forthrightly.
Rather than embracing ambiguous situations and difficult challenges, they
tended to get uncomfortable when facing them. It is the rare bird who has
the right mix of common sense, creativity, and character to shape change.


- No matter how much effort we put into screening new hires and training
them to work in our idea meritocracy, it was inevitable that many of them
would fall short. My approach was to hire, train, test, and then fire or
promote quickly, so that we could rapidly identify the excellent hires and get
rid of the ordinary ones, repeating the process again and again until the
percentage of those who were truly great was high enough to meet our
needs.


- It’s tough to be tough on people.



- It
seems
to
me
that
life
consists
of
three
phases.
In
the
first,
we
are
dependent on others and we learn. In the second, others depend on us and
we work. And in the third and last, when others no longer depend on us and
we no longer have to work, we are free to savor life.


- I was no longer as excited about being successful as I was about having the people I care about be successful without me


- My examination of shapers and my reflections on my own qualities made
clear to me that nobody sees the full range of what they need to see in order
to be exceptionally successful, though some see a wider range than others.
Those that do best both see a wide range themselves while triangulating well
with other brilliant people who see things in different, complementary ways.


- This exercise reminded me that there are far fewer types of people in the
world than there are people and far fewer different types of situations than
there are situations, so matching the right types of people to the right types
of situations is key.


- One of those heroes I have been fortunate enough to learn from and, I
hope, help is China’s Wang Qishan, who has been a remarkable force for
good for decades. To explain what he is like and the journey that took him to
the top of China’s leadership would take more of this book than I can spare.
In brief, Wang is a historian, a very high-level thinker, and a very practical
man. I have rarely known a person to be both extremely wise and extremely
practical. A leading shaper of the Chinese economy for decades who is also
responsible for eliminating corruption, he is known to be a no-nonsense
man who can be trusted to get stuff done.



- I gave Wang a copy of Joseph Campbell’s great book The Hero with a
Thousand Faces, because he is a classic hero and I thought it might help
him. I also gave him The Lessons of History, a 104-page distillation of the
major forces through history by Will and Ariel Durant, and River Out of
Eden by the insightful Richard Dawkins, which explains how evolution
works. He gave me Georgi Plekhanov’s classic On the Role of the Individual
in History. All these books showed how the same things happened over and
over again throughout history.



- For Campbell, a “hero” isn’t a perfect person who always gets things
right. Far from it. A hero is someone who “found or achieved or [did]
something beyond the normal range of achievement,” and who “has given
his life to something bigger than himself or other than himself.”


- Heroes
inevitably
experience
at
least
one
very
big
failure
(which
Campbell calls an “abyss” or the “belly of the whale” experience) that tests
whether they have the resilience to come back and fight smarter and with
more
determination.
If
they
do,
they
undergo
a
change
(have
a
“metamorphosis”) in which they experience the fear that protects them,
without losing the aggressiveness that propels them forward. With triumphs
come rewards. Though they don’t realize it when they are in their battles,
the hero’s biggest reward is what Campbell calls the “boon,” which is the
special knowledge about how to succeed that the hero has earned through
his journe



- Late in life, winning more battles and acquiring more rewards typically
becomes less exciting to heroes than passing along that knowledge to others
—“returning the boon” as Campbell called it. Once the boon is returned, the
hero is free to live and then free to die, or, as I see it, to transition from the
second phase in life to the third phase (in which one is free to savor life until
one passes away).


- Long before I had a lot of money, I had determined that I wanted my sons
to have only enough to afford excellent health care, excellent education, and
an
initial
boost
to
help
their
careers
get
started.
My
perspective
was
influenced by my own journey through life, which took me from having
nothing to having a lot. That taught me to struggle well and made me strong.
I wanted the same for the people I loved. So, when I had earned a lot of
money, I felt I had plenty of money to give away to others.



- We view our donations as investments and want to make sure that we
have high philanthropic returns on our money


- I began to experience painful moments in a
radically different way. Instead of feeling frustrated or overwhelmed, I saw
pain as nature’s reminder that there is something important for me to learn.
Encountering pains and figuring out the lessons they were trying to give me
became sort of a game to me.


- In
my
early
years,
I
looked
up
to
extraordinarily
successful
people,
thinking that they were successful because they were extraordinary. After I
got to know such people personally, I realized that all of them—like me, like
everyone—make mistakes, struggle with their weaknesses, and don’t feel
that they are particularly special or great. They are no happier than the rest
of us, and they struggle just as much or more than average folks. Even after
they surpass their wildest dreams, they still experience more struggle than
glory. This has certainly been true for me. While I surpassed my wildest
dreams decades ago, I am still struggling today. In time, I realized that the
satisfaction of success doesn’t come from achieving your goals, but from
struggling well. To understand what I mean, imagine your greatest goal,
whateveritis—making
ton
of
money,
running a great
a organization,
being great
at sport
winning
an
Academy
Award.
Now imagine
instantaneously achieving it. You’d be happy at first, but not for long. You
would soon find yourself needing something else to struggle for. Just look at
people who attain their dreams early—the child star, the lottery winner, the
professional athlete who peaks early. They typically don’t end up happy
unless they get excited about something else bigger and better to struggle
for. Since life brings both ups and downs, struggling well doesn’t just make
your ups better; it makes your downs less bad. I’m still struggling and I will
until I die, because even if I try to avoid the struggles, they will find me.


Thanks to all that struggling and
learning,
I have done
everything I
wanted to do, gone everywhere I wanted to go, met whomever I wanted to
meet,
gotten
everything
I
wanted
to
own,
had
a
career
that
has
been enthralling, and, most rewardingly, had many wonderful relationships. I have
experienced the full range, from having nothing to having an enormous
amount, and from being a nobody to being a somebody, so I know the
differences. While I experienced them going from the bottom up rather than
from
the
top
down
(which
was
preferable
and
probably
influenced
my
perspective), my assessment is that the incremental benefits of having a lot
and being on top are not nearly as great as most people think. Having the
basics—a good bed to sleep in, good relationships, good food, and good sex
—is most important, and those things don’t get much better when you have
a lot of money or much worse when you have less. And the people one
meets at the top aren’t necessarily more special than those one meets at the
bottom or in between.
The marginal benefits of having more fall off pretty quickly. In fact,
having a lot more is worse than having a moderate amount more because it
comes with heavy burdens. Being on top gives you a wider range of options,
but it also requires more of you. Being well-known is probably worse than
being anonymous, all things considered. And while the beneficial impact
one can have on others is great, when you put it in perspective, it is still
infinitesimally small. For all those reasons, I cannot say that having an
intense life filled with accomplishments is better than having a relaxed life
filled with savoring, though I can say that being strong is better than being
weak, and that struggling gives one strength. My nature being what it is, I
would not have changed my life, but I can’t tell you what is best for you.
That is for you to choose. What I have seen is that the happiest people
discover their own nature and match their life to it.



Now that my desire to succeed has given way to a desire to help others
succeed, that’s become my current struggle. It’s now clear to me that my
purpose, your purpose, and the purpose of everything else is to evolve and
to contribute to evolution in some small way. I didn’t think about that at the
start; I just went after the things I wanted. But along the way I evolved, and
now I am sharing these principles with you to help you evolve too. I realized
that passing on knowledge is like passing on DNA—it is more important
than the individual, because it lives way beyond the individual’s life. This is
my attempt to help you succeed by passing along to you what I learned
about how to struggle well—or, at the very least, to help you get the most
out of each unit of effort you put in.



- you will begin to understand how the machinery underlying
any “another one of those” works and develop a mental map for dealing
with it. As your understanding of these relationships grows, the essentials
stand out from the blizzard of things coming at you; you will notice which
“one of those” you are facing and instinctually apply the right principles to
help you through it. Reality, in turn, will send you loud signals about how
well your principles are working by rewarding or punishing you, so you will
learn to fine-tune them accordingly.



- There is nothing more important than understanding how reality works and
how to deal with it. The state of mind you bring to this process makes all the
difference. I have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in
which each problem I face is a puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle,
I get a gem in the form of a principle that helps me avoid the same sort of
problem
in
the
future.
Collecting
these
gems
continually
improves
my
decision making, so I am able to ascend to higher and higher levels of play
in which the game gets harder and the stakes become ever greater.



- a. Dreams + Reality + Determination = A Successful Life.
People who achieve
success and drive progress deeply understand the cause-effect relationships
that govern reality and have principles for using them to get what they want.
The converse is also true: Idealists who are not well grounded in reality
create problems, not progress.


- Over time I
learned that getting more out of life wasn’t just a matter of working harder at
it.
It was much more a matter
of working effectively,
because
working
effectively could increase my capacity by hundreds of times. I don’t care
what you want or how hard you want to work for it. That’s for you to decide.
I’m just trying to pass along to you what has helped me get the most out of
each hour of time and each unit of effort.
Most importantly, I’ve learned that there is no escaping the fact that:


- Most people fight seeing what’s true when it’s not what they want it to be.
That’s bad, because it is more important to understand and deal with the bad
stuff since the good stuff will take care of itself.


- None of us is born knowing what is true; we either have to discover what’s
true for ourselves or believe and follow others. The key is to know which
path will yield better results.15 I believe that:

- Radical
open-mindedness
and
radical
transparency
are
invaluable
for
rapid
learning and effective change. Learning is the product of a continuous real-time
feedback loop in which we make decisions, see their outcomes, and improve
our
understanding
of
reality
as
a
result.
Being
radically
open-minded
enhances the efficiency of those feedback loops, because it makes what you
are doing, and why, so clear to yourself and others that there can’t be any
misunderstandings. The more open-minded you are, the less likely you are
to deceive yourself—and the more likely it is that others will give you
honest feedback. If they are “believable” people (and it’s very important to
know who is “believable”16), you will learn a lot from them

It can also be difficult because being radically transparent
rather than more guarded exposes one to criticism. It’s natural to fear that.
Yet if you don’t put yourself out there with your radical transparency, you
won’t learn


- Don’t let fears of what others think of you stand in your way.
You must be
willing to do things in the unique ways you think are best—and to open-
mindedly reflect on the feedback that comes inevitably as a result of being
that way.


- I still instinctively
find
being
as
radically
transparent
in
the
ways
that
I
am
in
this
book
uncomfortable because I am exposing personal material to the public that
will attract attention and criticism. Yet I am doing it because I’ve learned
that it’s best, and I wouldn’t feel good about myself if I let my fears stand in
the way. In other words, I have experienced the positive effects of radical
transparency for so long that it’s now uncomfortable for me not to be that
way.



- Imagine
how
many fewer misunderstandings we would have and how much more efficient
the world would be—and how much closer we all would be to knowing
what’s true—if instead of hiding what they think, people shared it openly.


- Embracing radical truth and radical transparency will bring more meaningful
work and more meaningful relationships.
My experience, based on watching
thousands of people try this approach, is that with practice the vast majority
find it so rewarding and pleasurable that they have a hard time operating any
other way.


- This
takes
practice
and
changing
one’s
habits.
I
have
found
that
it
typically takes about eighteen months, which is how long it takes to change
most habits.




- . I’ve found it both interesting and valuable to observe which laws
we humans have in common with the rest of nature and which differentiate
us. Doing that has had a big impact on my approach to life.

- Seeing things from the top down is the best way to understand ourselves
and the laws of reality within the context of overarching universal laws.
That’s not to say it’s not worth having a bottom-up perspective. In fact, to
understand the world accurately you need both. By taking a bottom-up
perspective that looks at each individual case, we can see how it lines upwith our theories about the laws that we expect to govern it. When they line
up, we’re good.


- If
you
just
looked
at
one
species—ducks,
for
example—to
try
to
understand the universal laws, you’d fail. Similarly, if you just looked at
mankind to understand the universal laws, you’d fail. Man is just one of ten
million species and just one of the billions of manifestations of the forces
that bring together and take apart atoms through time. Yet most people are
like ants focused only on themselves and their own anthill; they believe the
universe revolves around people and don’t pay attention to the universal laws
that are true for all species.




- To try to figure out the universal laws of reality and principles for dealing
with
it,
I’ve
found
it
helpful
to
try
to
look
at
things
from
nature’s
perspective. While mankind is very intelligent in relation to other species,
we have the intelligence of moss growing on a rock compared to nature as a
whole. We are incapable of designing and building a mosquito, let alone all
the species and most of the other things in the universe. So I start from the
premise that nature is smarter than I am and try to let nature teach me how
reality works.



- Don’t get hung up on your views of how things “should” be because you will miss
out on learning how they really are.
It’s important not to let our biases stand in
the way of our objectivity. To get good results, we need to be analytical
rather than emotional.


- To me, nature seems to define good as what’s good for the whole
and optimizes for it, which is preferable. So I have come to believe that as a
general rule:


- To be “good” something must operate consistently with the laws of reality and
contribute to the evolution of the whole; that is what is most rewarded. For example,
if you come up with something the world values, you almost can’t help but
be rewarded. Conversely, reality tends to penalize those people, species, and
things that don’t work well and detract from evolution.17

- As I thought about evolution, I realized that it exists in other forms than
life and is carried out through other transmission mechanisms than DNA.
Technologies,
languages,
and
everything
else
evolves.
Knowledge,
for
example, is like DNA in that it is passed from generation to generation and
evolves; its impact on people over many generations can be as great or
greater than that of the genetic code.



- By looking at nature from the top down, we can see that much of what
we call human nature is really animal nature. That’s because the human
brain is programmed with millions of years of genetic learning that we share
with other species. Because we share common roots and common laws, we
and other animals have similar attributes and constraints






- If
you
just
looked
at
one
species—ducks,
for
example—to
try
to
understand the universal laws, you’d fail. Similarly, if you just looked at
mankind to understand the universal laws, you’d fail. Man is just one of ten
million species and just one of the billions of manifestations of the forces
that bring together and take apart atoms through time. Yet most people are
like ants focused only on themselves and their own anthill; they believe the
universe revolves around people and don’t pay attention to the universal laws
that are true for all species.


To try to figure out the universal laws of reality and principles for dealing
with
it,
I’ve
found
it
helpful
to
try
to
look
at
things
from
nature’s
perspective. While mankind is very intelligent in relation to other species,

the species and most of the other things in the universe. So I start from the
premise that nature is smarter than I am and try to let nature teach me how
reality works.


- I now realize that nature
optimizes for the whole, not for the individual, but most people judge good
and bad based only on how it affects them. What I had seen was the process
of
nature
at
work,
which
is
much
more
effective
at
furthering
the
improvement of the whole than any process man has ever invented.


- Most people call something bad if it is bad for them or bad for those they
empathize with, ignoring the greater good


- Typically, people’s conflicting
beliefs
or
conflicting
interests
make
them
unable
to
see
things
through
another’s eyes. That’s not good and it doesn’t make sense. While I could
understand people liking something that helps them and disliking things that
hurt
them,
it
doesn’t
make
sense
to
call
something
good
or
bad
in
an
absolute sense based only on how it affects individuals.


- To me, nature seems to define good as what’s good for the whole
and optimizes for it, which is preferable.


- To be “good” something must operate consistently with the laws of reality and
contribute to the evolution of the whole; that is what is most rewarded


- Evolution is the single greatest force in the universe; it is the only thing that is
permanent and it drives everything.


- As I thought about evolution, I realized that it exists in other forms than
life and is carried out through other transmission mechanisms than DNA.
Technologies,
languages,
and
everything
else
evolves.
Knowledge,
for
example, is like DNA in that it is passed from generation to generation and
evolves; its impact on people over many generations can be as great or
greater than that of the genetic code.



- we can see that perfection doesn’t exist; it is a goal
that fuels a never-ending process of adaptation. If nature, or anything, were
perfect it wouldn’t be evolving. Organisms, organizations, and individualpeople are always highly imperfect but capable of improving. So rather than
getting stuck hiding our mistakes and pretending we’re perfect, it makes
sense to find our imperfections and deal with them. You will either learn
valuable
lessons
from
your
mistakes
and

- Evolving is life’s greatest accomplishment and its
greatest reward.


- The individual’s incentives must be aligned with the group’s goals

- Reality is optimizing for the whole—not for you.

- There are at least three
kinds of learning that foster evolution: memory-based learning (storing the
information that comes in through one’s conscious mind so that we can
recall it later); subconscious learning (the knowledge we take away from our
experiences that never enters our conscious minds, though it affects our
decision making); and “learning” that occurs without thinking at all, such as
the changes in DNA that encode a species’ adaptations.



- I used to think that
memory-based, conscious learning was the most powerful, but I’ve since
come
to
understand
that
it
produces
less
rapid
progress
than
experimentation and adaptation. To give you an example of how nature
improves without thinking, just look at the struggle that mankind (with all
its thinking) has experienced in trying to outsmart viruses (which don’t even
have brains).


- Realize that you are simultaneously everything and nothing—and decide what you
want to be.


- Earth is just one of about 100 billion planets in our
galaxy, which is just one of about two trillion galaxies in the universe. And
our lifetimes are only about 1/3,000 of humanity’s existence, which itself is
only 1/20,000 of the Earth’s existence. In other words, we are unbelievably
tiny and short-lived and no matter what we accomplish, our impact will be
insignificant.



- At
the
same
time,
we
instinctually
want
to
matter
and
to
evolve, and we can matter a tiny bit—and it’s all those tiny bits that add up
to drive the evolution of the universe.


- The question is how we matter and evolve. Do we matter to others (who
also don’t matter in the grand scope of things) or in some greater sense that
we will never actually achieve? Or does it not matter if we matter so we
should forget about the question and just enjoy our lives while they last?



- What you will be will depend on the perspective you have.
Where you go in life
will depend on how you see things and who and what you feel connected to
(your family, your community, your country, mankind, the whole ecosystem,
everything). You will have to decide to what extent you will put the interests
of others above your own, and which others you will choose to do so for.
That’s because you will regularly encounter situations that will force you to
make such choices


- For me personally, I now find it thrilling to embrace reality, to look down
on myself through nature’s perspective, and to be an infinitesimally small
part of the whole. My instinctual and intellectual goal is simply to evolveand contribute to evolution in some tiny way while I’m here and while I am
what I am.


- When I began to look at reality
through
the
perspective
of
figuring
out
how
it
really
works,
instead
of
thinking things should be different, I realized that most everything that at
first seemed “bad” to me—like rainy days, weaknesses, and even death—
was because I held preconceived notions of what I personally wanted. With
time, I learned that my initial reaction was because I hadn’t put whatever I
was reacting to in the context of the fact that reality is built to optimize for
the whole rather than for me


- This
constant
drive
toward
learning
and
improvement
makes
getting
better innately enjoyable and getting better fast exhilarating. Though most
people think that they are striving to get the things (toys, bigger houses,
money, status, etc.) that will make them happy, for most people those things
don’t supply anywhere near the long-term satisfaction that getting better at
something does.20 Once we get the things we are striving for, we rarely
remain satisfied with them. The things are just the bait. Chasing after them
forces us to evolve, and it is the evolution and not the rewards themselvesthat matters to us and to those around us.


This means that for most people
success is struggling and evolving as effectively as possible, i.e., learning
rapidly about oneself and one’s environment, and then changing to improve.



- People who earn so much
that they derive little or no marginal gains from it will experience negative
consequences, as with any other form of excess, like gluttony. If they are
intellectually healthy, they will begin seeking something new or seeking new
depths in something old—and they will get stronger in the process. As
Freud put it, “Love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness.”
The work doesn’t necessarily have to be a job, though I believe it’s
generally better if it is a job. It can be any kind of long-term challenge that
leads to personal improvement. As you might have guessed, I believe that
the need to have meaningful work is connected to man’s innate desire to
improve. And relationships are the natural connections to others that make
us relevant to each other and to society more broadly.


- b. Remember “no pain, no gain.”
Realizing that we innately want to evolve—
and that the other stuff we are going after, while nice, won’t sustain our
happiness—has helped me focus on my goals of evolving and contributing
to evolution in my own infinitely small way. While we don’t like pain,
everything that nature made has a purpose, so nature gave us pain for a
purpose. So what is its purpose? It alerts us and helps direct us.


- c. It is a fundamental law of nature that in order to gain strength one has to push
one’s limits, which is painful. As Carl Jung put it, “Man needs difficulties. They
are necessary for health.” Yet most people instinctually avoid pain. This is
true whether we are talking about building the body (e.g., weight lifting) or
the mind (e.g., frustration, mental struggle, embarrassment, shame)—and
especially
true
when
people
confront
the
imperfections.

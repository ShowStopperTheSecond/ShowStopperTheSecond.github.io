Anna Karenina is a timeless classic by Leo Tolstoy that delves into themes of love, marriage, and societal expectations. It's a captivating story that explores the complexities of human relationships and the challenges faced by individuals in a restrictive society.

Without spoiling the plot, I can tell you that the novel follows two main characters: Anna Karenina, a high-society woman struggling with her marriage, and Konstantin Levin, a landowner searching for meaning in life. Their stories intertwine as they navigate personal challenges and societal pressures.

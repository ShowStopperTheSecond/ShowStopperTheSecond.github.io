Animal Farm is a dystopian novella by George Orwell published in 1945. It is an allegory for the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism in the Soviet Union.

The story revolves around a group of farm animals who rebel against their human owner, Mr. Jones, and establish their own society. The animals are led by a pig named Old Major, who outlines a vision of a utopian society where all animals are equal. After Old Major's death, two pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, emerge as the leaders of the rebellion.

Snowball advocates for education and democracy, while Napoleon is more interested in power and control. Eventually, Napoleon, with the help of the dogs he has trained, ousts Snowball from the farm. Napoleon then establishes a dictatorship, using fear and propaganda to maintain his control over the other animals.

The novel's central themes include:

- Corruption of power: The story shows how power can corrupt even the best intentions.
- The dangers of totalitarianism: Napoleon's dictatorship is a warning against the dangers of authoritarian rule.
- The importance of education: Snowball's belief in education is contrasted with Napoleon's suppression of knowledge.
- The betrayal of ideals: The animals' initial dream of a utopian society is betrayed by Napoleon's greed and ambition.
- Animal Farm is a powerful and thought-provoking novel that continues to be relevant today. Its message about the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of critical thinking is as timely as ever.

      <h1 id="page-title" class="page__title">Finite And InfiniteGames</h1>
    
    <h1 id="interesting-qoutes">Interesting qoutes:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an invariable principle of all play, finite and infinite, that whoever plays, plays freely. Whoever must play, cannot play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the case that we cannot play if we must play, but it is also the case that we cannot play alone. Thus, in every case, we must find an opponent, and in most cases teammates, who are willing to join in play with us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because finite players cannot select themselves for play, there is never a time when they cannot be removed from the game, or when the other contestants cannot refuse to play with them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The world is elaborately marked by boundaries of contest, its people finely classified as to their eligibilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one respect, but only one, an infinite game is identical to a finite game: Of infinite players we can also say that if they play they play freely; if they must play, they cannot play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finite games can be played within an infinite game, but an infinite game cannot be played within a finite game. Infinite players regard their wins and losses in whatever finite games they play as but moments in continuing play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If finite games must be externally bounded by time, space, and number, they must also have internal limitations on what the players can do to and with each other. To agree on internal limitations is to establish rules of play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreement of the players to the applicable rules constitutes the ultimate validation of those rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rules are not valid because the Senate passed them, or because heroes once played by them, or because God pronounced them through Moses or Muhammad. They are valid only if and when players freely play by them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no rules that require us to obey rules. If there were, there would have to be a rule for those rules, and so on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the rules of a finite game are unique to that game it is evident that the rules may not change in the course of play—else a different game is being played. It is on this point that we find the most critical distinction between finite and infinite play: The rules of an infinite game must change in the course of play.The rules are changed when the players of an infinite game agree that the play is imperiled by a finite outcome—that is, by the victory of some players and the defeat of others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rules of an infinite game are changed to prevent anyone from winning the game and to bring as many persons as possible into the play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the rules of a finite game are the contractual terms by which the players can agree who has won, the rules of an infinite game are the contractual terms by which the players agree to continue playing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rule- making capacity of infinite players is often challenged by the impingement of powerful boundaries against their play—such as physical exhaustion, or the loss of material resources, or the hostility of nonplayers, or death.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The task is to design rules that will allow the players to continue the game by taking these limits into play—even when death is one of the limits. It is in this sense that the game is infinite.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it may be evident enough in theory that whoever plays a finite game plays freely, it is often the case that finite players will be unaware of this absolute freedom and will come to think that whatever they do they must do</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some self- veiling is present in all finite games. Players must intentionally forget the inherently voluntary nature of their play, else all competitive effort will desert them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dramatically, one chooses to be a mother; theatrically, one takes on the role of mother.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One obeys the rules in a finite game in order to play, but playing does not consist only in obeying rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A finite player is trained not only to anticipate every future possibility, but to control the future, to prevent it from altering the past.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since finite games can be played within an infinite game, infinite players do not eschew the performed roles of finite play. On the contrary, they enter into finite games with all the appropriate energy and self- veiling, but they do so without the seriousness of finite players.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surprise is a crucial element in most finite games. If we are not prepared to meet each of the possible moves of an opponent, our chances of losing are most certainly increased. It is therefore by surprising our opponent that we are most likely to win. Surprise in finite play is the triumph of the past over the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be prepared against surprise is to be trained. To be prepared for surprise is to be educated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The infinite player does not expect only to be amused by surprise, but to
be transformed by it, for surprise does not alter some abstract past, but
one’s own personal past.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education discovers an increasing richness in the past, because it sees
what is unfinished there. Training regards the past as finished and the
future as to be finished. Education leads toward a continuing self- 
discovery; training leads toward a final self- definition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Training repeats a completed past in the future. Education continues
an unfinished past into the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What one wins in a finite game is a title.
A title is the acknowledgment of others that one has been the winner of
a particular game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since titles are timeless, but exist only so far as they are
acknowledged, we must find means to guarantee the memory of them.
The birettas of dead cardinals are suspended from the ceilings of
cathedrals, as it were forever; the numbers of great athletes are “retired”
or withdrawn from all further play; great achievements are carved in
imperishable stone or memorialized by perpetual flames.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some titles are inherited, though only when the bloodline or some
other tangible connection with the original winner has been established,
suggesting that the winners have continued to exist in their descendants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Death in life is a mode of existence in which one has ceased all play;
there is no further striving for titles. All competitive engagement with
others has been abandoned. For some, though not for all, death in life is
a misfortune, the resigned acceptance of a loser’s status, a refusal to
hold any title up for recognition. For others, however, death in life can
be regarded as an achievement, the result of a spiritual discipline, say,
intended to extinguish all traces of struggle with the world, a liberation
from the need for any title whatsoever. “Die before ye die,” declare the
Sufi mystics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Life in death concerns those who are titled and whose titles, since
they are timeless, may not be extinguished by death. Immortality, in this
case, is not a reward but the condition necessary to the possession of
rewards. Victors live forever not because their souls are unaffected by
death but because their titles must not be forgotten.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soldiers commonly achieve a life in death. Soldiers fight not to stay
alive but to save the nation. Those who do fight only to protect
themselves are, in fact, considered guilty of the highest military crimes.
Soldiers who die fighting the enemy, however, receive the nation’s
highest reward: They are declared unforgettable. Even unknown soldiers
are memorialized—though their names have been lost, their titles will
not be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the winners of finite games achieve is not properly an afterlife
but an afterworld, not continuing existence but continuing recognition
of their titles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A slave can have life only by giving it away. “He who loves his life
loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal
life” (Jesus).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Death is not, therefore, chosen, but inflicted. It happens to one when the struggle against it fails. Death comes as a judgment, a dishonor, a sign of certain weakness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the losers are dead, the dead are also losers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Death, for finite players, is abstract, not concrete. It is not the whole
person, but only an abstracted fragment of the whole, that dies in life or
lives in death.
So also is life abstract for finite players. It is not the whole person
who lives. If life is a means to life, we must abstract ourselves, but only
for the sake of winning an abstraction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immortality is therefore the supreme example of the
contradictoriness of finite play: It is a life one cannot live.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The death of an infinite player is dramatic. It does not mean that the
game comes to an end with death; on the contrary, infinite players offer
their death as a way of continuing the play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infinite players play best when they become least necessary to the
continuation of play. It is for this reason they play as mortals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The joyfulness of infinite play, its laughter, lies in learning to start
something we cannot finish.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Names, like titles, are given. Persons cannot name themselves any
more than they can entitle themselves. However, unlike titles, which are
given for what a person has done, a name is given at birth—at a time
when a person cannot yet have done anything. Titles are given at the
end of play, names at the beginning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a person is known by title, the attention is on a completed
past, on a game already concluded, and not therefore to be played
again. A title effectively takes a person out of play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a person is known only by name, the attention of others is on
an open future. We simply cannot know what to expect. Whenever we
address each other by name we ignore all scripts, and open the
possibility that our relationship will become deeply reciprocal. That I
cannot now predict your future is exactly what makes mine
unpredictable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Titles, then, point backward in time. They have their origin in an
unrepeatable past.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mode and content of address and the manner of behavior are
recognitions of the areas in which titled persons are no longer in
competition. There are precise ways in which one may no longer
compete with the Dalai Lama or the Heavyweight Champion of the
World. There is no possible action by which one may deprive them of
their titles to contests now in the past. Therefore, insofar as we
recognize their titles we withdraw from any contest with them in those
areas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The titled are powerful. Those around them are expected to yield, to
withdraw their opposition, and to conform to their will—in the arena in
which the title was won.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exercise of power also presupposes a closed field and finite units
of time. My power is determined by the amount of resistance I can
displace within given spatial and temporal limits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To speak meaningfully of a person’s power is to speak of what that
person has already completed in one or another closed field. To see
power is to look backward in time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inasmuch as power is determined by the outcome of a game, one
does not win by being powerful; one wins to be powerful. If one has
sufficient power to win before the game has begun, what follows is not a
game at all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Power is bestowed by an audience after the play is complete.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems plainly false to say that power is theatrical.
And yet, the theatrical nature of power seems to be consistent with
the principle arrived at earlier: Whoever must play cannot play. The
intuitive idea in that principle is that no one can engage us competitively
unless we fully cooperate, unless we join the game and join it to win.
Because power is measurable only in comparative—that is, competitive
—terms, it presupposes some kind of cooperation. If we defer to titled
winners, it is only because we regard ourselves as losers. To do so is
freely to take part in the theater of power.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I accept death as inevitable, I do not struggle against mortality. I
struggle as a mortal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infinite players do not oppose the actions of others, but initiate actions of their
own in such a way that others will respond by initiating their own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A powerful person is one who brings the past to an outcome, settling
all its unresolved issues. A strong person is one who carries the past into
the future, showing that none of its issues is capable of resolution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strength is paradoxical. I am not strong because I can force others to
do what I wish as a result of my play with them, but because I can allow
them to do what they wish in the course of my play with them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Power refers to
the freedom persons have within limits, strength to the freedom persons
have with limits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evil is the termination of infinite play. It is infinite play coming to an end in unheard silence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unheard silence does not necessarily mean the death of the player.
Unheard silence is not the loss of the player’s voice, but the loss of
listeners for that voice. It is an evil when the drama of a life does not
continue in others for reason of their deafness or ignorance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are silences that can be heard, even from the dead and from
the severely oppressed. Much is recoverable from an apparently
forgotten past. Sensitive and faithful historians can learn much of what
has been lost, and much therefore that can be continued.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evil is not the attempt to eliminate the play of another according to
published and accepted rules, but to eliminate the play of another
regardless of the rules. Evil is not the acquisition of power, but the
expression of power. It is the forced recognition of a title—and therein
lies the contradiction of evil, for recognition cannot be forced. The
Nazis did not compete with the Jews for a title, but demanded
recognition of a title without competition. This could be achieved,
however, only by silencing the Jews, only by hearing nothing from them.
They were to die in silence, along with their culture, without anyone
noticing, not even those who managed the institutions and instruments
of death.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evil arises in the honored belief that history can be tidied up, brought to a sensible conclusion. It is evil to act as though the past is bringing us to a specifiable end. It is evil to assume that the past will make sense only if we bring it to an issue we have clearly in view. It is evil for a nation to believe it is “the last, best hope on earth.” It is evil to think history is to end with a return to Zion, or with the classless society, or with the Islamicization of all living infidels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infinite players understand the inescapable likelihood of evil. They
therefore do not attempt to eliminate evil in others, for to do so is the
very impulse of evil itself, and therefore a contradiction. They only
attempt paradoxically to recognize in themselves the evil that takes the
form of attempting to eliminate evil elsewhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot be human by oneself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not relate to others as the persons we are; we are who we are in relating to others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only that which can change can continue: this is the principle by which infinite
players live.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the open playfulness of children is
exploited through organized athletic, artistic, and educational regimens
as a means of preparing the young for serious adult competition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as infinite play cannot be contained within finite play, culture
cannot be authentic if held within the boundaries of a society.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Society and culture are therefore not true opponents of each other.
Rather society is a species of culture that persists in contradicting itself,
a freely organized attempt to conceal the freedom of the organizers and
the organized, an attempt to forget that we have willfully forgotten our
decision to enter this or that contest and to continue in it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Heroes of lost battles are almost never memorialized.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how to contain the serious within the
truly playful; that is, how to keep all our finite games in infinite play.
This challenge is commonly misunderstood as the need to find room
for playfulness within finite games.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Theycan see that the dream of freedom is universal, that wars are fought to
win it, heroes die to protect it, and songs are written to commemorate
its attainment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we think of society as all that a people does under the veil of
necessity, we must also think of it as a single finite game that includes
any number of smaller games within its boundaries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like a finite game, a society is numerically, spatially, and temporally
limited. Its citizenship is precisely defined, its boundaries are inviolable,
and its past is enshrined.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the interest of a society therefore to encourage
competition within itself, to establish the largest possible number of
prizes, for the holders of prizes will be those most likely to defend the
society as a whole against its competitors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Culture, on the other hand, is an infinite game. Culture has no
boundaries. Anyone can be a participant in a culture—anywhere and at
any time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because culture as such can have no temporal limits, a culture
understands its past not as destiny, but as history, that is, as a narrative
that has begun but points always toward the endlessly open. Culture is
an enterprise of mortals, disdaining to protect themselves against
surprise. Living in the strength of their vision, they eschew power and
make joyous play of boundaries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Society is a manifestation of power. It is theatrical, having an
established script. Deviations from the script are evident at once.
Deviation is antisocietal and therefore forbidden by society under a
variety of sanctions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deviancy, however, is the very essence of culture. Whoever merely
follows the script, merely repeating the past, is culturally impoverished.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are variations in the quality of deviation; not all divergence
from the past is culturally significant. Any attempt to vary from the past
in such a way as to cut the past off, causing it to be forgotten, has little
cultural importance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cultural deviation does not return us to the past, but continues what
was begun and not finished in the past. Societal convention, on the
other hand, requires that a completed past be repeated in the future.
Society has all the seriousness of immortal necessity; culture resounds
with the laughter of unexpected possibility. Society is abstract, culture
concrete.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finite games can be played again; they can be played an indefinite
number of times. It is true that the winners of a game are always the
winners of a game played at that particular time, but the validity of their
titles depends on the repeatability of that game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we have seen, because an infinite game cannot be brought to an
end, it cannot be repeated. Unrepeatability is a characteristic of culture
everywhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as an infinite game has rules, a culture has a tradition. Since the
rules of play in an infinite game are freely agreed to and freely altered, a
cultural tradition is both adopted and transformed in its adoption.
Properly speaking, a culture does not have a tradition; it is a
tradition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential to the identity of a society to forget that it has forgotten
that society is always a species of culture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential to the identity of a society to forget that it has forgotten
that society is always a species of culture. Its citizens must find ways ofpersuading themselves that their own particular boundaries have been
imposed on them, and were not freely chosen by them. For example, it
is one thing for persons to choose to be Americans, quite another for
persons to choose to be America. Societal thinking easily permits the
former, never the latter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most effective means of self- persuasion available to a
citizenry is the bestowal of property.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore essential to the effectiveness of every title that it be
visible and that in its visibility it point back at the contest in which it
was won. The purpose of property is to make our titles visible. Property
is emblematic. It recalls to others those areas in which our victories are
beyond challenge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Property may be stolen, but the thief does not therefore own it.
Ownership can never be stolen. Titles are timeless, and so is the
ownership of property.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thief means to win the title, believing that those things to which Iclaim title belong to no one and are there for the taking</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One reason for the necessity of a society is its role in ascribing and
validating the titles to property. “The great and chief end therefore, of
Mens uniting into Commonwealths, and putting themselves under
Government, is the preservation of their Property; to which in the state
of nature there are many things wanting” (Locke).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no effective pattern of entitlement in a society short of the free agreement
of all opponents that the titles to property are in the hands of the actual
winners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not proceed through a traffic intersection
because the signal changes, but when the signal changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a society’s rules and regulations are only effective because people have agreed to follow them. The agreement to abide by these rules gives them the force to govern behavior. In other words, people who willingly participate in a society accept the constraints imposed by that society as necessary guidelines for how to act within it. However, if people do not consent to the rules of a society, they will not see them as helpful guidelines but as oppressive and will resist or oppose them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who challenge the existing pattern of entitlements in a society
do not consider the designated officers of enforcement powerful; they
consider them opponents in a struggle that will determine by its
outcome who is powerful. One does not win by power; one wins to be
powerful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The theatricality of property has, in fact, an elaborate structure that
property owners must be at considerable labor to sustain. If property is
to be persuasively emblematic, that is, if it is to draw attention to the
owner’s titles in past victories, a double burden falls on its owners:
First, they must show that the amount of their property corresponds
to the difficulty they were under in winning title to it. Property must be
seen as compensation.
Second, they must show that the type of their property corresponds
to the nature of the competition by which title to it was won. Property
must be seen to be consumed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Property is appropriately compensatory whenever owners can show
that what is gained is no more than what was expended in the effort to
acquire it. There must be an equivalency between what the owners have
given of themselves and what they have received from others by way of
their titles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whoever is unable to show a correspondence between wealth and the
risks undergone to acquire it, or the talents spent in its acquisition, will
soon face a challenge over entitlement. The rich are regularly subject to
theft, to taxation, to the expectation that their wealth be shared, as
though what they have is not true compensation and therefore not
completely theirs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Property is an attempt to recover the past. It returns one to
precompetitive status. One is compensated for the amount of time spent
(and thus lost) in competition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a second theatrical requirement that falls on the owners of
property. Once they have drawn attention to what they have lost in
acquiring what they own, they must then consume what they have
gained in a way that recovers the loss.The intuitive principle here is that
we cannot be justified in owning what we do not need to use or plan to
use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intuitive principle here is that
we cannot be justified in owning what we do not need to use or plan to
use. One does not earn money merely to store it away where it will be
protected from all possible future use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consumption is a kind of activity that is directly opposite to the very
form of engagement by which the title was won. It must be the kind of
activity that can convince all observers that the possesser’s title to it is
no longer in question</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After athletic contests in which major titles have been at stake, it
is common for the audience to lift the winners to their shoulders,
marching them about as if they were helpless—in the sharpest possible
contrast to the physical skill and energy they have just displayed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consumption is an activity so different from gainful labor that it
shows itself in the mode of leisure, even indolence. We display the
success of what we have done by not having to do anything. The more
we use up, therefore, the more we show ourselves to be winners of past
contests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one of the reasons for uniting into commonwealths is the
protection of property, and if property is to be protected less by power
as such than by theater, then societies become acutely dependent on
their artists—what Plato called poietai: the storytellers, the inventors,
sculptors, poets, any original thinkers whatsoever</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But any policy of forceful restraint so extreme that it requires an
officer for each potential criminal is a formula for quick descent into
social chaos.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If wealth and might are to be performed, great wealth and great
might must be performed brilliantly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While societal thinkers may not overlook the importance of poiesis,
or creative activity, neither may they underestimate its danger, for the
poietai are the ones most likely to remember what has been forgotten—
that society is a species of culture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deepest and most consequent struggle of each society is therefore
not with other societies, but with the culture that exists within itself—
the culture that is itself</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conflict with other societies is, in fact, an
effective way for a society to restrain its own culture</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Powerful societies do not silence their poietai in order that they may go to war; they go to
war as a way of silencing their poietai.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Culture is likely to break out in a society not when its poietai begin
to voice a line contrary to that of the society, but when they begin to
ignore all lines whatsoever and concern themselves with bringing the
audience back into play—not competitive play, but play that affirms
itself as play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Art is not art, therefore, except as it leads to an engendering
creativity in its beholders. Whoever takes possession of the objects of art
has not taken possession of the art.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since art is never possession, and always possibility, nothing
possessed can have the status of art. If art cannot become property,
property is never art—as property. Property draws attention to titles,
points backward toward a finished time. Art is dramatic, opening
always forward, beginning something that cannot be finished.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To regard society as a species of culture is not to overthrow or even
alter society, but only to eliminate its perceived necessity. Infinite players
have rules; they just do not forget that rules are an expression of
agreement and not a requirement for agreement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason it can be said that where a society is defined by its
boundaries, a culture is defined by its horizon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A boundary is a phenomenon of opposition. It is the meeting place
of hostile forces. Where nothing opposes there can be no boundary. One
cannot move beyond a boundary without being resisted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why patriotism—that is, the desire to protect the power in a
society by way of increasing the power of a society—is inherently
belligerent. Since there can be no prizes without a society, no society
without opponents, patriots must create enemies before we can require
protection from them. Patriots can flourish only where boundaries are
well- defined, hostile, and dangerous. The spirit of patriotism is therefore
characteristically associated with the military or other modes of
international conflict.
Because patriotism is the desire to contain all other finite games
within itself—that is, to embrace all horizons within a single boundary
—it is inherently evil.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A horizon is a phenomenon of vision. One cannot look at the
horizon; it is simply the point beyond which we cannot see. There is
nothing in the horizon itself, however, that limits vision, for the horizon
opens onto all that lies beyond itself. What limits vision is rather the
incompleteness of that vision.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are never somewhere in relation to the horizon since the horizon
moves with our vision. We can only be somewhere by turning away from
the horizon, by replacing vision with opposition, by declaring the place
on which we stand to be timeless—a sacred region, a holy land, a body
of truth, a code of inviolable commandments. To be somewhere is to
absolutize time, space, and number.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every move an infinite player makes is toward the horizon. Every
move made by a finite player is within a boundary. Every moment of an
infinite game therefore presents a new vision, a new range of
possibilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the degree that the Renaissance was true culture it has not ended.
Anyone may enter into its mode of renewing vision. This does not mean
that we repeat what was done. To enter a culture is not to do what the
others do, but to do whatever one does with the others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why every new participant in a culture both enters into an
existing context and simultaneously changes that context. Each new
speaker of its language both learns the language and alters it. Each new
adoption of a tradition makes it a new tradition—just as the family into
which a child is born existed prior to that birth, but is nonetheless a new
family after the birth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any culture that continues to influence our vision
continues to grow in the very exercise of that influence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since a culture is not anything persons do, but anything they do with
each other, we may say that a culture comes into being whenever
persons choose to be a people. It is as a people that they arrange their
rules with each other, their moralities, their modes of communication.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A culture is sometimes opposed by suppressing its ideas, its works,
even its language. This is a common strategy of a society afraid of the
culture growing within its boundaries. But it is a strategy certain to fail,
because it confuses the creative activity (poiesis) with the product
(poiema) of that activity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Societies characteristically separate the ideas from their thinkers, the
poiema from its poietes. A society abstracts its thought and grants
power to certain ideas as though they had an existence of their own
independent from those who think them, even those who first produced
them. In fact, a society is likely to have an idea of itself that no thinker
may challenge or revise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A people, as a people, has nothing to defend. In the same way a
people has nothing and no one to attack. One cannot be free by
opposing another. My freedom does not depend on your loss of
freedom. On the contrary, since freedom is never freedom from society,
but freedom for it, my freedom inherently affirms yours.
A people has no enemies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a bounded, metaphysically veiled, and destined society, enemies
are necessary, conflict inevitable, and war likely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>War is not an act of unchecked ruthlessness but a declared contest
between bounded societies, or states. If a state has no enemies it has no
boundaries. To keep its definitions clear a state must stimulate danger to
itself. Under the constant danger of war the people of a state are far
more attentive and obedient to the finite structures of their society: “just
as the blowing of the winds preserves the sea from the foulness which
would be the result of a prolonged calm, so also corruption in nations
would be the product of prolonged, let alone ‘perpetual’ peace” (Hegel).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finite players
go to war against states because they endanger boundaries; infinite
players oppose states because they engender boundaries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strategy of finite players is to kill a state by killing the people
who invented it. Infinite players, however, understanding war to be a
conflict between states, conclude that states can have only states as
enemies; they cannot have persons as enemies. “Sometimes it is possible
to kill a state without killing a single one of its members; and war gives
no right which is not necessary to the gaining of its object”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For infinite players the chief difficulty with finite players’
commitment to war is not, however, that persons are killed. Indeed,
finite players themselves often genuinely regret this and do as little
killing as possible. The difficulty is that such warfare has in it the
contradiction of all finite play. Winning a war can be as destructive as
losing one, for if boundaries lose their clarity, as they do in a decisive
victory, the state loses its identity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A war
fought to end all wars, in the strategy of finite play, only breeds
universal warfare.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>War presents itself as necessary for self- protection, when in fact it is
necessary for self- identification.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is the impulse of a finite player to go against another nation in
war, it is the design of an infinite player to oppose war within a nation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plato suggested that some of the poets be driven out of the Republic
because they had the power to weaken the guardians. Poets can make it
impossible to have a war—unless they tell stories that agree with the
“general line” established by the state. Poets who have no metaphysics,
and therefore no political line, make war impossible because they have
the irresistible ability to show the guardians that what seems necessary
is only possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The danger of the poets, for Plato, is that they can imitate so well
that it is difficult to see what is true and what is merely invented. Since
reality cannot be invented, but only discovered through the exercise of
reason—according to Plato—all poets must be put into the service of
reason. The poets are to surround the citizens of the Republic with such
art as will “lead them unawares from childhood to love of, resemblance
to, and harmony with, the beauty of reason.”
The use of the word “unawares” shows Plato’s intention to keep the
metaphysical veil intact. Those who are being led to reason cannot be
aware of it. They must be led to it without choosing it. Plato asks his
poets not to create, but to deceive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Metaphysics is about the real but is abstract. Poetry is the making
(poiesis) of the real and is concrete. Whenever what is made (poiema) is
separated from the maker (poietes), it becomes metaphysical. As it
stands there, and as the voice of the poietes is no longer listened to, the
poiema is an object to be studied, not an act to be learned. One cannot
learn an object, but only the poiesis, or the act of creating objects. To
separate the poiema from poiesis, the created object from the creative
act, is the essence of the theatrical.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I speak as the genius I am, I speak these words for the first
time. To repeat words is to speak them as though another were saying
them, in which case I am not saying them. To be the genius of my
speech is to be the origin of my words, to say them for the first, and last,
time. Even to repeat my own words is to say them as though I were
another person in another time and place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you do not truly speak the words that reside
entirely in their own sound, neither can you think that which remains
thought or can be translated back into thought. In thinking you cast
thoughts beyond themselves, surrendering them to that which they
cannot be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To speak, or act, or think originally is to erase the boundary of the
self. It is to leave behind the territorial personality. A genius does not
have a mind full of thoughts but is the thinker of thoughts, and is the
center of a field of vision. It is a field of vision, however, that is
recognized as a field of vision only when we see that it includes within
itself the original centers of other fields of vision.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the geniuses we are, we do not look but see.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To look at something is to look at it within its limitations. I look at
what is marked off, at what stands apart from other things. But things
do not have their own limitations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was not looking at the sea gulls as though it was the sea gulls
who happened to be there—I was looking for something to make this
example. I might have seen them as a sign that land is not far, or that
the sea is not far; I could have been looking for a form to reproduce on
a canvas or in a poem. To look at is to look for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If to look is to look at what is contained within its limitations, to see
is to see the limitations themselves. Each new school of painting is new
not because it now contains subject matter ignored in earlier work, but
because it sees the limitations previous artists imposed on their subject
matter but could not see themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we pass from looking to seeing, we do not therefore lose our
sight of the objects observed. Seeing, in fact, does not disturb our
looking at all. It rather places us in that territory as its genius, aware
that our imagination does not create within its outlines but creates the
outlines themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be the genius of myself is not to bring myself into being. As the
origin of myself I am not also the cause of myself, as though I were the
product of my own action. But then neither am I the product of any
other action. My parents may have wanted a child, but they could not
have wanted me.
I am both the outcome of my past and the transformation of my
past.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking in purely causal terms, I cannot say I was born; I should
say rather that I have emerged as a phase in the process of reproduction.
A reproduction is a repetition, a recurrence of that which has been.
Birth, on the other hand, in causal terms, is all discontinuity. It has its
beginning in itself, and can be caused by nothing. It makes no sense to
say, “I was reproduced on this date and in this place.” To say “I was
born” is to speak of myself as having an uncaused point of departure
within the realm of the continuous, an absolute beginning not
comprehensible to the explanatory intelligence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As such a phenomenon birth repeats nothing; it is not the outcome
of the past but the recasting of a drama already under way</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Theatrically, my birth is an event of plotted repetition. I am born as
another member of my family and my culture. Who I am is a question
already answered by the content and character of a tradition.
Dramatically, my birth is the rupture of that repetitive sequence, an
event certain to change what the past has meant. In this case the
character of a tradition is determined by who I am. Dramatically
speaking, every birth is the birth of genius.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The drama under way at the time of my birth is moved forward to
new possibilities by the appearance of a new genius within it. It is a
drama, however, already peopled by finite players attempting to forget,
playing for keeps. If I am born into, and add to, the culture of a family, I
am also a product and a citizen of its politics. I first experience the
conflict between the theatrical and the dramatic in the felt pressure to
take up one of the roles prepared for me: eldest son, favorite daughter,
heir to the family’s honor, avenger of its losses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not allowing the past to be past may be the primary source for the
seriousness of finite players. Inasmuch as finite play always has its
audience, it is the audience to whom the finite player intends to be
known as winner. The finite player, in other words, must not only have
an audience but must have an audience to convince.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As with all finite play, an acute contradiction quickly develops at the
heart of this attempt. As finite players we will not enter the game with
sufficient desire to win unless we are ourselves convinced by the very
audience we intend to convince. That is, unless we believe we actually are
the losers the audience sees us to be, we will not have the necessary desire
to win. The more negatively we assess ourselves, the more we strive to
reverse the negative judgment of others. The outcome brings the
contradiction to perfection: by proving to the audience they were
wrong, we prove to ourselves the audience was right.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it is only by remembering what we have forgotten that we can
enter into competition with sufficient intensity to be able to forget we
have forgotten the character of all play: Whoever must play cannot play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever we act as the genius of ourselves, it will be in the spirit of
allowing the past to be past. It is the genius in us who is capable of
ridding us of resentment by exercising what Nietzsche called the
“faculty of oblivion,” not as a way of denying the past but as a way of
reshaping it through our own originality. Then we forget that we have
been forgotten by an audience, and remember that we have forgotten
our freedom to play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in the culture into which we are born there are always persons who
will urge us to theatricalize our lives by supplying us with a repeatable
past, there will also be persons (possibly the same ones) in whose
presence we learn to prepare ourselves for surprise. It is in the presence
of such persons that we first recognize ourselves as the geniuses we are.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When actors bring themselves to tears by
their performance, and not as their performance, they have failed their
craft; they have become theatrically inept. 
This means that we can be moved only by persons who are not what
they are; we can be moved only when we are not who we are, but are
what we cannot be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I am touched, I am touched only as the person I am behind all
the theatrical masks, but at the same time I am changed from within—
and whoever touches me is touched as well. We do not touch by design.
Indeed, all designs are shattered by touching. Whoever touches and
whoever is touched cannot but be surprised. (The unpredictability of
this phenomenon is reflected in our reference to the insane as
“touched.”)
We can be moved only by way of our veils. We are touched through
our veils.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The character of touching can be seen quite clearly in the way infinite
players understand both healing and sexuality.
If to be touched is to respond from one’s center, it is also to respond
as a whole person. To be whole is to be hale, or healthy. In sum,whoever is touched is healed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The finite player’s interest is not in being healed, or made whole, but
in being cured, or made functional. Healing restores me to play, curing
restores me to competition in one or another game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be ill is to be dysfunctional; to be
dysfunctional is to be unable to compete in one’s preferred contests. It is
a kind of death, an inability to acquire titles. The ill become invisible.
Illness always has the smell of death about it: Either it may lead to
death, or it leads to the death of a person as competitor. The dread of
illness is the dread of losing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is never ill in general. One is always ill with relation to some
bounded activity. It is not cancer that makes me ill. It is because I
cannot work, or run, or swallow that I am ill with cancer. The loss of
function, the obstruction of an activity, cannot in itself destroy my
health. I am too heavy to fly by flapping my arms, but I do not for that
reason complain of being sick with weight. However, if I desired to be a
fashion model, a dancer, or a jockey, I would consider excessive weight
to be a kind of disease and would be likely to consult a doctor, a
nutritionist, or another specialist to be cured of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I am healed I am restored to my center in a way that my
freedom as a person is not compromised by my loss of functions. This
means that the illness need not be eliminated before I can be healed. I
am not free to the degree that I can overcome my infirmities, but only to
the degree that I can put my infirmities into play. I am cured of my
illness; I am healed with my illness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because sexuality is a drama of origins, it gives full expression to the
genius you are and to the genius of others who participate in that
drama. This throws a high challenge before the political ideologue.
Aware that genuine sexual expression is at least as dangerous to society
as genuine artistic expression, the sexual metaphysician can appeal to at
least two powerful solutions. One is to treat sexuality as a process of
reproduction; another is to place it in the area of feeling and behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although reproduction is a process that operates by way of our
bodies, it nonetheless operates autonomously. Like every other natural
process it is a phenomenon of causal continuity, having no inherent
beginning or end. Therefore we cannot be said to initiate the process by
any act of our own. We can only be carried along by it, inasmuch as
conception occurs only when all the necessary conditions have been met
by the parenting couple. No one conceives a child; a child is conceived
in the conjunction of sperm and ovum. The mother does not give birth
to a child; the mother is where the birth occurs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A society shows its mastery in the management of sexuality not when
it sets out unambiguous standards for sexual behavior or prescribed
attitudes toward sexual feelings, but when it institutionalizes the
emblematic display of sexual conquest. These institutions can be as
varied as burning widows alive on the funeral pyres of their husbands or
requiring the high visibility of a spouse at an elected official’s
inauguration.
Finite sexuality is a form of theater in which the distance between
persons is regularly reduced to zero but in which neither touches the
other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as sexuality is a drama of origin it is original to society and
not derivative of it. It is therefore somewhat misleading to describe
society as a regulator of finite sexual play. It is more the case that finite
sexuality shapes society than is shaped by it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only to a limited extent do
we take on the sexual roles assigned us by society. Much more
frequently we enter into societal arrangements by way of sexual roles.
(For example, we are more likely to refer to the king as the father of the
country than we are to refer to the father as king of the family.) While
society does serve a regulatory function, it is probably more correctly
understood as sexuality making use of society to regulate itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that society plays little or no role in either causing or
preventing sexual tensions. On the contrary, society absorbs sexual
tensions into all of its structures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Society is where we prove to parents qua audience that we are not what we
thought they thought we were. Since the emphasis in this relationship is
not on what our parents thought of us but on what we thought they
thought, they become an audience that easily survives their physical
absence or death. Moreover, for the same reason they become an
audience whose definitive approval we can never win</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one other way in which society is shaped by the tensions of
finite sexuality: in its orientation toward property. Since sexuality is the
only finite game in which the winner’s prize is the loser, the most
desirable form of property is the publicly acknowledged possession of
another’s person, a relationship to which the possessed must of course
freely consent. All other forms of property are considerably less
desirable, even when they are vast in quantity. The true value of my
property, in fact, varies not with its monetary worth but with its
effectiveness in winning for me the declaration that I am the Master
Player in our game with each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most serious struggles are those for sexual property. For this
wars are fought, lives are generously risked, great schemes are initiated.
However, who wins empire, fortune, and fame but loses in love has lost
in everything.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because finite, or veiled, sexuality is one or another struggle which its
participants mean to win, it is oriented toward moments, outcomes,
final scenes. Like all finite play it proceeds largely by deception. Sexual
desires are usually not directly announced but concealed under a series
of feints, gestures, styles of dress, and showy behavior. Seductions are
staged, scripted, costumed. Certain responses are sought, plots are
developed. In skillful seductions delays are employed, special
circumstances and settings are arranged.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By contrast, infinite players have no interest in seduction or in
restricting the freedom of another to one’s own boundaries of play.
Infinite players recognize choice in all aspects of sexuality. They may see
in themselves and in others, for example, the infant’s desire to compete
for the mother, but they also see that there is neither physiological norsocietal destiny in sexual patterns. Who chooses to compete with
another can also choose to play with another</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sexuality is not a bounded phenomenon but a horizonal
phenomenon for infinite players. One can never say, therefore, that an
infinite player is homosexual, or heterosexual, or celibate, or adulterous,
or faithful—because each of these definitions has to do with
boundaries, with circumscribed areas and styles of play. Infinite players
do not play within sexual boundaries, but with sexual boundaries. They
are concerned not with power but with vision. :|
Moving therefore from an original center, the sexual engagements of
infinite players have no standards, no ideals, no marks of success or
failure. Neither orgasm nor conception is a goal in their play, although
either may be part of the play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing hidden in infinite sexuality. Sexual desire is exposed
as sexual desire and is never therefore serious. Its satisfaction is never an
achievement, but an act in a continuing relationship, and therefore
joyous. Its lack of satisfaction is never a failure, but only a matter to be
taken on into further play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No family is united by
natural or any other kind of necessity. Families can convene only out of
choice. The family of infinite lovers has this difference, that it is self-
evidently chosen. It is a progressive work of unveiling. Fathering and
mothering are roles freely assumed but always with the design of
showing them to be theatrical. It is the intention of parents in such
families to make it plain to their children that they all play cultural and
not societal roles, that they are only roles, and that they are all trulyconcrete persons behind them. Therefore, children also learn that they
have a family only by choosing to have it, by a collective act to be a
family with each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The triumph of finite sexuality is to be liberated from play into the
body. The essence of infinite sexuality is to be liberated into play with
the body. In finite sexuality I expect to relate to you as a body; in infinite
sexuality I expect to relate to you in your body.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infinite sexuality does not focus its attention on certain parts or
regions of the body. Infinite lovers have no “private parts.” They do not
regard their bodies as having secret zones that can be exposed or made
accessible to others for special favors. It is not their bodies but their
persons they make accessible to others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rules of a finite game will indicate the temporal, spatial, and
numerical nature of the game itself; that, for example, it will last sixty
minutes, will be played on a field 100 yards in length, and by two teams
of eleven players each. But the rules do not, and cannot, determine the
date, the location, and the specific participants. There is nothing in the
rules that requires professional teams composed of certain persons,
earning salaries of specified amounts, joining at the end of each season
in a national championship.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot have a precise understanding of what it means to be the
winner of a contest until we can place the game in the absolute
dimensions of a world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>World exists in the form of audience. A world is not all that is the
case, but that which determines all that is the case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of persons who join an audience is irrelevant. So is the
time and space in which an audience occurs. The temporal and spatial
boundaries of a finite game must be absolute—in relation to an
audience or a world. But when and where a world occurs, and whom it
includes, is of no importance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An audience does not receive its identity
according to the persons within it, but according to the events it
observes. Those who remember that day remember precisely what they
were doing in the early afternoon of that day, not because it was the 22d
of November, but because it was at that moment that they became
audience to the events of that day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the boundaries of an audience are irrelevant, what is relevant is the
unity of the audience. They must be a singular entity, bound in their
desire to see who will win the contest before them. Anyone for whom
this desire is not primary is not in the audience for that contest, and is
not a person in that world</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finite players need the world to provide an absolute reference for
understanding themselves; simultaneously, the world needs the theater
of finite play to remain a world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are players in search of a world as often as we are world in search
of players, and sometimes we are both at once. Some worlds pass
quickly into existence, and quickly out of it. Some sustain themselves
for longer periods, but no world lasts forever.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reciprocity of game and world has another, deeper effect on the
persons involved. Because the seriousness of finite play derives from the
players’ need to correct another’s putative assessment of themselves,
there is no requirement that the audience be physically present, since
players are already their own audience. Just as in finite sexuality where
the absence or death of parents has no effect on the child’s
determination to prove them wrong, finite players become their own
hostile observers in the very act of competing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot be a finite player without being divided against myself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A similar dynamic is found in the audience. When sufficiently
oblivious to their status as audience, the observers of a finite game
become so absorbed in its conduct that they lose the sense of distance
between themselves and the players. It is they, quite as much as the
players, who win or lose. For this reason the audience absorbs in itself
the same politics of resentment that moves players to show they are not
what they think others think they are. The audience is under the same
constraint to disprove this judgment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A finite game does not have its own time. It exists in a world’s time.
An audience allows players only so much time to win their titles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early in a game time seems abundant, and there appears a greater
freedom to develop future strategies. Late in a game, time is rapidly
being consumed. As choices become more limited they become more
important. Errors are more disastrous.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We look on childhood and youth as those “times of life” rich with
possibility only because there still seem to remain so many paths open
to a successful outcome. Each year that passes, however, increases the
competitive value of making strategically correct decisions. The errors
of childhood can be more easily amended than those of adulthood.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The outcome of a finite game is the past waiting to happen. Whoever
plays toward a certain outcome desires a particular past. By competing
for a future prize, finite players compete for a prized past</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The infinite player in us does not consume time but generates it.
Because infinite play is dramatic and has no scripted conclusion, its time
is time lived and not time viewed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an infinite player one is neither young nor old, for one does not
live in the time of another. There is therefore no external measure of an
infinite player’s temporality. Time does not pass for an infinite player.
Each moment of time is a beginning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each moment is not the beginning of a period of time. It is the
beginning of an event that gives the time within it its specific quality.
For an infinite player there is no such thing as an hour of time. There
can be an hour of love, or a day of grieving, or a season of learning, or a
period of labor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An infinite player does not begin working for the purpose of filling
up a period of time with work, but for the purpose of filling work with
time. Work is not an infinite player’s way of passing time, but of
engendering possibility. Work is not a way of arriving at a desired
present and securing it against an unpredictable future, but of moving
toward a future which itself has a future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infinite players cannot say how much they have completed in their
work or love or quarreling, but only that much remains incomplete in it.
They are not concerned to determine when it is over, but only what
comes of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the finite player in us freedom is a function of time. We must
have the time to be free. For the infinite player in us time is a function of
freedom. We are free to have time. A finite player puts play into time.
An infinite player puts time into play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infinite play remains invisible to the finite observer. Such viewers are
looking for closure, for the ways in which players can bring matters to a
conclusion and finish whatever remains unfinished. They are looking for
the way time has exhausted itself, or will soon do so. Finite players
stand before infinite play as they stand before art, looking at it, making
a poiema of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, however, the observers see the poiesis in the work they cease at
once being observers. They find themselves in its time, aware that it
remains unfinished, aware that their reading of the poetry is itself
poetry. Infected then by the genius of the artist they recover their own
genius, becoming beginners with nothing but possibility ahead of them.
If the goal of finite play is to win titles for their timelessness, and thus
eternal life for oneself, the essence of infinite play is the paradoxical
engagement with temporality that Meister Eckhart called “eternal
birth.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nature, to be
commanded, must be obeyed It is as though, by learning its
secret script, we have learned to direct its play as well. There is little left
to surprise us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assumption guiding our struggle against nature is that deep
within itself nature contains a structure, an order, that is ultimately
intelligible to the human understanding. Since this inherent structure
determines the way things change, and is not itself subject to change, we
speak of nature being lawful, of repeating itself according to quite
predictable patterns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have done by showing that certain events repeat themselves
according to known laws is to explain them. Explanation is the mode of
discourse in which we show why matters must be as they are. All laws
made use of in explanation look backward in time from the conclusion
or the completion of a sequence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What can
be explained can also be predicted, if one knows the initial events andthe laws covering their succession. A prediction is but an explanation in
advance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of its thorough lawfulness nature has no genius of its own.
On the contrary, it is sometimes thought that the grandest discovery of
the human genius is the perfect compatibility between the structure of
the natural order and the structure of the mind, thereby making a
complete understanding of nature possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This achievement is often raised as a sign of the great superiority of
modern civilization over the many faded and lost civilizations of the
ancients. While our great skill lies in finding patterns of repetition under
the apparent play of accident and chance, less successful civilizations
dealt with the threats of natural accident by appealing to supernatural
powers for protection. But the voices of the gods proved to be ignorant
and false; they have been silenced by the truth.</p>

the natural order and the structure of the mind, thereby making a
complete understanding of nature possible. “One may say ‘the eternal
mystery of the world is its comprehensibility’” (Einstein).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is as much as to say that nature does have a voice, and its voice
is no different from our own. We can then presume to speak for the
unspeakable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While our great skill lies in finding patterns of repetition under
the apparent play of accident and chance, less successful civilizations
dealt with the threats of natural accident by appealing to supernatural
powers for protection. But the voices of the gods proved to be ignorant
and false; they have been silenced by the truth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an irony in our silencing of the gods. By presuming to speak
for the unspeakable, by hearing our own voice as the voice of nature, we
have had to step outside the circle of nature. It is one thing for physics
and chemistry to be speaking about nature; it is quite another for
physics and chemistry to be the speaking of nature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If speaking about a process is itself
part of the process, there is something that must remain permanently
hidden from the speaker. To be intelligible at all, we must claim that we
can step aside from the process and comment on it “objectively” and
“dispassionately,” without anything obstructing our view of these
matters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of this perfectly reasonable claim
the gods have stolen back into our struggle with nature. By depriving
the gods of their own voices, the gods have taken ours. It is we whospeak as supernatural intelligences and powers, masters of the forces of nature. This irony passes unnoticed only so long as we continue to veil
ourselves against what we can otherwise plainly see: nature allows no
master over itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no such thing as an unnatural act. Nothing
can be done to or against nature, much less outside it. Therefore, the
ignorance we thought we could avoid by an unclouded observation of
nature has swept us back into itself. What we thought we read in nature
we discover we have read into nature. “We have to remember that what
we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of
questioning” (Heisenberg).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are speaking now of no ordinary ignorance. It is not what we
could have known but do not; it is unintelligibility itself: that which no
mind can ever comprehend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unveiled, aware of the insuperable limitation placed against all our
looking, we come back to nature’s perfect silence. Now we can see that
it is a silence so complete there is no way of knowing what it is silent
about—if anything. What we learn from this silence is the unlikeness
between nature and whatever we could think or say about it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this
silence has an irony of its own: Far from stupefying us, it provides an
indispensable condition to the mind’s own originality. By confronting us
with radical unlikeness, nature becomes the source of metaphor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At its root all language has the character of metaphor, because no
matter what it intends to be about it remains language, and remains
absolutely unlike whatever it is about.
This means that we can never
have the falcon, only the word “falcon.” To say that we have the falcon,and not the “falcon,” is to presume again that we know precisely what it
is we have, that we can see it in its entirety, and that we can speak as
nature itself</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our attempt to take control of nature, to be Master Player in our
opposition to it, is an attempt to rid ourselves of language. It is the
refusal to accept nature as “nature.” It is to deafen ourselves to
metaphor, and to make nature into something so familiar it is essentially
an extension of our willing and speaking. What the hunter kills is not
the deer, but the metaphor of the deer—the “deer.” Killing the deer is
not an act against nature; it is an act against language. To kill is to
impose a silence that remains a silence. It is the reduction of an
unpredictable vitality to a predictable mass, the transformation of the
remote into the familiar. It is to rid oneself of the need to attend to its
otherness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If nature is the realm of the unspeakable, history is the realm of the
speakable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, no speaking is possible that is not itself historical.
Students of history, like students of nature, often believe they can find
unbiased, direct views of events. They look in on the lives of others,
noting the multitude of ways those lives have been limited by the age in
which they were lived. But no one can look in on an age, even if it is
one’s own age, without looking out of an age as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since history is the drama of genius, its relentless surprise tempts us
into designing boundaries for it, searching through it for patterns of
repetition. Historians sometimes speak of trends, of cycles, of currents,
of forces, as though they were describing natural events. In doing so
they must dehistoricize themselves, taking a perspective from the
timeless, believing that each observed history is always of others andnever of themselves, that each observation is of history but not itself
historical.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Genuine historians therefore reverse the assumption of the observers
of nature that the observation itself cannot be an act of nature.
Historians who understand themselves to be historical abandon
explanation altogether. The mode of discourse appropriate to such self-
aware history is narrative.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like explanation, narrative is concerned with a sequence of events
and brings its tale to a conclusion. However, there is no general law that
makes this outcome necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explanations place all apparent possibilities
into the context of the necessary; stories set all necessities into the
context of the possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explanation can tolerate a degree of chance, but it cannot
comprehend freedom at all. We explain nothing when we say that
persons do whatever they do because they choose to do it. On the other
hand, causation cannot find a place in narrative. We have not told a
story when we show that persons do whatever they do because they
were caused to do it—by their genes, their social circumstances, or the
influence of the gods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explanations settle issues, showing that matters must end as they
have. Narratives raise issues, showing that matters do not end as they
must but as they do. Explanation sets the need for further inquiry aside;
narrative invites us to rethink what we thought we knew.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Successful explanations do not draw attention to themselves as
modes of speaking, because what is explained is not itself subject to
history. If I explain to you why cold water sinks to the bottom of the
pond and ice rises to the surface, I certainly do not intend my
explanation to be true now and not later. The explanation is true
anywhere and any time. That I choose to explain this to you in this time and place, however,
is historical; it is an event—the narrative of our relation with each other.
There must therefore be a reason for the speaking of this verity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can explain nothing to you unless I first draw your attention
to patent inadequacies in your knowledge: discontinuities in the
relations between objects, or the presence of anomalies you cannot
account for by any of the laws known to you. You will remain deaf to
my explanations until you suspect yourself of falsehood.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these suspicions are, of course, minor, requiring merely
small adjustments in one’s views, incurring no doubt whatsoever
concerning those views. Major challenges, however, are too serious to be
met with argument, or with sharpened explanation. They call either for
outright and wholesale rejection, or for conversion. One does not cross
over from Manichaeism to Christianity, or from Lamarckianism to
Darwinism, by a mere adjustment of views. True conversions consist in
the choice of a new audience, that is, of a new world. All that was once
familiar is now seen in startlingly new ways.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explanations succeed only by convincing resistant hearers of their
error. If you will not hear my explanations until you are suspicious of
your own truths, you will not accept my explanations until you are
convinced of your error. Explanation is an antagonistic encounter that
succeeds by defeating an opponent. It possesses the same dynamic of
resentment found in other finite play. I will press my explanations onyou because I need to show that I do not live in the error that I think
others think I do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whoever wins this struggle is privileged with the claim to true
knowledge. Knowledge has been arrived at, it is the outcome of this
engagement. Its winners have the uncontested power to make certain
statements of fact. They are to be listened to. In those areas appropriate
to the contests now concluded, winners possess a knowledge that no
longer can be challenged.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowledge, therefore, is like property. It must be published, declared,
or in some other way so displayed that others cannot but take account
of it. It must stand in their way. It must be emblematic, pointing
backward at its possessor’s competitive skill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If explanation, to be successful, must be oblivious to the silence of
nature, it must also in its success impose silence on its listeners. Imposed
silence is the first consequence of the Master Player’s triumph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What one wins in a title is the privilege of magisterial speech. The
privilege of magisterial speech is the highest honor attaching to any title.
We expect the first act of a winner to be a speech. The first act of the
loser may also be a speech, but it will be a speech to concede victory, to
declare there will be no further challenge to the winner. It is a speech
that promises to silence the loser’s voice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The silence to which the losers pledge themselves is the silence of
obedience. Losers have nothing to say; nor have they an audience who
would listen. The vanquished are effectively of one will with the victors,
and of one mind; they are completely incapable of opposition, and
therefore without any otherness whatsoever.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The victorious do not speak with the defeated; they speak for the
defeated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be powerful is to have one’s words obeyed. It is only by magisterial
speech that the emblematic property of winners can be safeguarded.
Those entitled to their possessions have the privilege of calling the
police, calling up an army, to force the recognition of their emblems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The speech of a god can be so perfectly expressive of that god’s
power that the god and its speech become identical: “In the beginning
was the word. The word was with God, and the word was God.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is speechless before a god, or silent before a winner, because it
no longer matters to others what one has to say. To lose a contest is to
become obedient; to become obedient is to lose one’s listeners. The
silence of obedience is an unheard silence. It is the silence of death. For
this reason the demand for obedience is inherently evil.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infinite speech is that mode of discourse that consistently reminds us
of the unspeakability of nature. It bears no claim to truth, originating
from nothing but the genius of the speaker. Infinite speech is therefore
not about anything; it is always to someone. It is not command, but
address. It belongs entirely to the speakable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the role
of metaphor to draw our sight to what is there, but to draw our vision
toward what is not there and, indeed, cannot be anywhere. Metaphor ishorizonal, reminding us that it is one’s vision that is limited, and not
what one is viewing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The meaning of a finite speaker’s discourse lies in what precedes its
utterance, what is already the case and therefore is the case whether or
not it is spoken.</p>
  </li>

    <p>The meaning of a finite speaker’s discourse lies in what precedes its
utterance, what is already the case and therefore is the case whether or
not it is spoken.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The meaning of an infinite speaker’s discourse lies in what comes of
its utterance—that is, whatever is the case because it is spoken.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finite language exists complete before it is spoken. There is first a
language—then we learn to speak it. Infinite language exists only as it is
spoken. There is first a language—when we learn to speak it. It is in this
sense that infinite discourse always arises from a perfect silence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because it is address, attending always on the response of the
addressed, infinite speech has the form of listening. Infinite speech does
not end in the obedient silence of the hearer, but continues by way of the
attentive silence of the speaker. It is not a silence into which speech has
died, but a silence from which speech is born.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infinite speakers do not give voice to another, but receive it from
another. Infinite speakers do not therefore appeal to a world as
audience, do not speak before a world, but present themselves as an
audience by way of talking with others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finite speech informs another
about the world—for the sake of being heard. Infinite speech forms a
world about the other—for the sake of listening.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Storytellers do not convert their listeners; they do not move them
into the territory of a superior truth. Ignoring the issue of truth and
falsehood altogether, they offer only vision. Storytelling is therefore not
combative; it does not succeed or fail. A story cannot be obeyed.
Instead of placing one body of knowledge against another, storytellers
invite us to return from knowledge to thinking, from a bounded way of
looking to an horizonal way of seeing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infinite speakers are Plato’s poietai taking their place in the
historical. Storytellers enter the historical not when their speaking is full
of anecdotes about actual persons, or when they appear as characters in
their own tales, but when in their speaking we begin to see the narrative
character of our lives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fate arises not as a limitation on our freedom, but as a
manifestation of our freedom, testimony that choice is consequent. Theexercise of your freedom cannot prevent the exercise of my own
freedom, but it can determine the context in which I am to act freely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We become listeners who see that we are
listening and therefore participating in a now enlarged drama of origins.
Nothing is explained here. On the contrary, what we see is that
everything remains still to be said.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I were to know the full story of my life I would then have translated it
back into explanation. It is as though I could stand as audience to
myself, seeing the opening scene and the final scene at the same time, as
though I could see my life in its entirety. In doing so I would be
performing it, not living it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What they listen to in
their poiesis is the disclosure that wherever there is closure there is the
possibility of a new opening, that they do not die at the end, but in the
course of play. Neither do they know anyone else’s story in its entirety.
The primary work of historians is to open all cultural termini, to reveal
continuity where we have assumed something has ended, to remind us
that no one’s life, and no culture, can be known, as one would know a
poiema, but only learned, as one would learn a poiesis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A small group of physicists, using calculations of the highest known
abstraction, uncovered a predictable sequence of subatomic reactions
that led directly to the construction of a thermonuclear bomb. It is true
that the successful detonation of the bomb proved the predictions of the
physicists, but it is also true that we did not explode the bomb to prove
them correct; we exploded it to control the behavior of millions of
persons and to bring our relations with them to a certain closure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this example shows is not that we can exercise power over
nature, but that our attempt to do so masks our desire for power over
each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alternative attitudes toward nature can be characterized in a
rough way by saying that the result of approaching nature as a hostile
Other whose designs are basically inimical to our interests is the
machine, while the result of learning to discipline ourselves to consist
with the deepest discernable patterns of natural order is the garden</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Garden” does not refer to the bounded plot at the edge of the house
or the margin of the city. This is not a garden one lives beside, but agarden one lives within. It is a place of growth, of maximized
spontaneity. To garden is not to engage in a hobby or an amusement; it
is to design a culture capable of adjusting to the widest possible range of
surprise in nature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most elemental difference between the machine and the garden is
that one is driven by a force which must be introduced from without,
the other grown by an energy which originates from within itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly gardens can be treated with such a range of chemical and
technological strategies that we can speak of “raising” food, and of the
food we have raised as “produce.” But no way has been found, or can be
found, by which organic growth can be forced from without</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as nature has no outside, it has no inside</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not divided within
itself and cannot therefore be used for or against itself. There is no
inherent opposition of the living and the nonliving within nature;
neither is more or less natural than the other. The use of agricultural
poisons, for example, will surely kill selected organisms; it will arrest the
spontaneity of living entities—but it is not an unnatural act. Nature has
not been changed. All that changes is the way we discipline ourselves to
consist with natural order</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our freedom in relation to nature is not the freedom to change
nature; it is not the possession of power over natural phenomena. It is
the freedom to change ourselves. We are perfectly free to design a
culture that will turn on the awareness that vitality cannot be given but
only found, that the given patterns of spontaneity in nature are not only
to be respected, but to be celebrated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although “natural order” is the common expression, it has
something of a veiling quality about it. More properly speaking, it is not
the order of nature but its irreducible spontaneity with which we find
ourselves contending.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chaos and order describe the cultural
experience of nature—the degree to which nature’s indifferent
spontaneity seems to agree with our current manner of cultural self-
control. A hurricane, or a plague, or the overpopulation of the earth will
seem chaotic to those whose cultural expectations are damaged by them
and orderly to those whose expectations have been confirmed by them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The paradox in our relation to nature is that the more deeply a
culture respects the indifference of nature, the more creatively it will call
upon its own spontaneity in response. The more clearly we remind
ourselves that we can have no unnatural influence on nature, the more
our culture will embody a freedom to embrace surprise and
unpredictability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The contradiction in our relation to nature is that the more vigorously
we attempt to force its agreement with our own designs the more subject
we are to its indifference, the more vulnerable to its unseeing forces. The
more power we exercise over natural process the more powerless we
become before it. In a matter of months we can cut down a rain forest
that took tens of thousands of years to grow, but we are helpless in
repulsing the desert that takes its place. And the desert, of course, is no
less natural than the forest</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To operate a machine one must operate like a machine. Using a
machine to do what we cannot do, we find we must do what the
machine does.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no style in operating a
machine. The more efficient the machine, the more it either limits or
absorbs our uniqueness into its operation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, we come to think that the style of operation does not belong
to the operator at all, but is inherent in the machine. Advertisers and
manufacturers speak of their products as though they have designed
style into them. Most consumer products are “styled” inasmuch as they
actually standardize the activity or the taste of the consumer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a
perfect contradiction we are urged to buy a “styled” artifact because
others are also buying it—that is, we are asked to express our genius by
giving up our genius.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we make use of machinery in the belief we can increase the
range of our freedom, and instead only decrease it, we use machines
against ourselves.??????????????????????</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Machinery is contradictory in another way. Just as we use machinery
against ourselves, we also use machinery against itself. A machine is not
a way of doing something; it stands in the way of doing something</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we use machines to achieve whatever it is we desire, we cannot
have what we desire until we have finished with the machine, until we
can rid ourselves of the mechanical means of reaching our intended
outcome. The goal of technology is therefore to eliminate itself, to
become silent, invisible, carefree.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When machinery functions perfectly it ceases to be there—but so do
we. Radios and films allow us to be where we are not and not be where
we are. Morever, machinery is veiling. It is a way of hiding our inaction
from ourselves under what appear to be actions of great effectiveness.
We persuade ourselves that, comfortably seated behind the wheels of
our autos, shielded from every unpleasant change of weather, and
raising or lowering our foot an inch or two, we have actually traveled
somewhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be at
home everywhere is to neutralize space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the importance of reducing time in travel: by arriving as
quickly as possible we need not feel as though we had left at all, that
neither space nor time can affect us—as though they belong to us, and
not we to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not go somewhere in a car, but arrive somewhere in a car.
Automobiles do not make travel possible, but make it possible for us to
move locations without traveling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, the theatricality of machinery: Such movement is but a change
of scenes. If effective, the machinery will see to it that we remain
untouched by the elements, by other travelers, by those whose towns or
lives we are traveling through. We can see without being seen, move
without being touched.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it is most effective, machinery will have no effect at all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In still another way is machinery contradictory. Using it against itself
and against ourselves, we also use machinery against each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If to operate a machine is to operate like a machine, then we not only
operate with each other like machines, we operate each other like
machines. And if a machine is most effective when it has no effect, then
we operate each other in such a way that we reach the outcome desired
—in such a way that nothing happens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inherent hostility of machine-mediated relatedness is nowhere
more evident than in the use of the most theatrical machines of all:
instruments of war. All weapons are designed to affect others without
affecting ourselves, to make others answerable to the technology in our
control. Weapons are the equipment of finite games designed in such a
way that they do not maximize the play but eliminate it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Weapons are
meant not to win contests but to end them. Killers are not victors; they
are unopposed competitors, players without a game, living
contradictions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Killers can suffer no suggestion that
they are living into the open, that their histories are not finished, that
their freedom is always a freedom with others, and not over others, that
it is not their vision that is limited but what they are viewing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not everyone who uses machinery is a killer. But when the use of
machinery springs from our attempt to respond to the indifference of
nature with an indifference of our own to nature, we have begun to
acquire the very indifference to persons that has led to the century’s
grandest crimes by its most civilized nations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If indifference to nature leads to the machine, the indifference of
nature leads to the garden. All culture has the form of gardening: the
encouragement of spontaneity in others by way of one’s own, the
respect for source, and the refusal to convert source into resource.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gardeners slaughter no animals. They kill nothing. Fruits, seeds,
vegetables, nuts, grains, grasses, roots, flowers, herbs, berries—all are
collected when they have ripened, and when their collection is in the
interest of the garden’s heightened and continued vitality. Harvesting
respects a source, leaves it unexploited, suffers it to be as it is.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Animals cannot be harvested. They mature, but they do not “ripen.”
They are killed not when they have completed the cycle of their vitality
but when they are at the peak of their vitality. Finite gardeners,
converting agriculture into commerce, “raise” or “produce” animals—
or meat products—as though by machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Animal husbandry is a
science, a method of controlling growth. It assumes that animals belong
to us. What is source in them is to be resource for us. Cattle are confined
to pens to prevent such movement as would “toughen” their flesh.
Geese, their feet nailed to the floor, are force fed like machines until they
can be butchered for their fattened livers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While machinery is meant to work changes without changing its
operators, gardening transforms its workers. One learns how to drive a
car, one learns to drive as a car; but one becomes a gardener.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gardening is not outcome-oriented. A successful harvest is not the
end of a garden’s existence, but only a phase of it. As any gardener
knows, the vitality of a garden does not end with a harvest. It simply
takes another form. Gardens do not “die” in the winter but quietly
prepare for another season.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gardeners celebrate variety, unlikeness, spontaneity. They
understand that an abundance of styles is in the interest of vitality. The
more complex the organic content of the soil, for example—that is, the
more numerous its sources of change—the more vigorous its liveliness.
Growth promotes growth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So also in culture. Infinite players understand that the vigor of a
culture has to do with the variety of its sources, the differences within
itself. The unique and the surprising are not suppressed in some persons
for the strength of others. The genius in you stimulates the genius in me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One operates a machine effectively, so that it disappears, giving way
to results in which the machine has no part. One gardens creatively, sothat all the sources of the garden’s vitality appear in its harvest, giving
rise to a continuity in which we take an active part.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inasmuch as gardens do not conclude with a harvest and are not
played for a certain outcome, one never arrives anywhere with a garden.
A garden is a place where growth is found. It has its own source of
change. One does not bring change to a garden, but comes to a garden
prepared for change, and therefore prepared to change</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True parents do not see to it that
their children grow in a particular way, according to a preferred pattern
or scripted stages, but they see to it that they grow with their children.
The character of one’s parenting, if it is genuinely dramatic, must be
constantly altered from within as the children change from within. So,
too, with teaching, or working with, or loving each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Genuine travel has no destination. Travelers do not go somewhere,
but constantly discover they are somewhere else. Since gardening is a
way not of subduing the indifference of nature but of raising one’s own
spontaneity to respond to the disregarding vagaries and
unpredictabilities of nature, we do not look on nature as a sequence of
changing scenes but look on ourselves as persons in passage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nature does not change; it has no inside or outside. It is therefore not
possible to travel through it. All travel is therefore change within the
traveler, and it is for that reason that travelers are always somewhere
else. To travel is to grow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Genuine travelers travel not to overcome distance but to discover
distance. It is not distance that makes travel necessary, but travel that
makes distance possible. Distance is not determined by the measurable
length between objects, but by the actual differences between them. The
motels around the airports in Chicago and Atlanta are so little different
from the motels around the airports of Tokyo and Frankfurt that all
essential distances dissolve in likeness. What is truly separated is
distinct</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A gardener, whose attention is ever on the spontaneities of nature,
acquires the gift of seeing differences, looks always for the merest
changes in plant growth, or in the composition of the soil, the emerging
populations of insects and earthworms. So will gardeners, as parents,
see changes of the smallest subtlety in their children, or as teachers see
the signs of an increasing skill, and possibly wisdom, in their students.
A garden, a family, a classroom—any place of human gathering
whatsoever—will offer no end of variations to be observed, each an
arrow pointing toward yet more changes. But these observed changes
are not theatrically amusing to genuine gardeners; they dramatically
open themselves to a renewed future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since machinery requires force from without, its use always requires
a search for consumable power. When we think of nature as resource, it
is as a resource for power. As we preoccupy ourselves with machinery,
nature is increasingly thought of as a reservoir of needed substances. It
is a quantity of materials that exist to be consumed, chiefly in our
machines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being undivided, nature cannot be used against itself. We do not
therefore consume it, or exhaust it We simply rearrange our societal
patterns in a way that reduces our ability to respond creatively to the
existing patterns of spontaneity.
That is, to use the societal expression,
we create waste. Waste, of course, is by no means unnatural. The trash
and garbage of a civilization do not befoul nature; they are nature—but
in a form society no longer is able to exploit for its own ends.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Society regards its waste as an unfortunate, but necessary,
consequence of its activities—what is left when we have made essential
societal goods available. But waste is not the result of what we havemade. It is what we have made. Waste plutonium is not an indirect
consequence of the nuclear industry; it is a product of that industry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waste is unveiling. As we find ourselves standing in garbage that we
know is our own, we find also that it is garbage we have chosen to make,
and having chosen to make it could choose not to make it. Because
waste is unveiling, we remove it. We place it where it is out of sight. We
either find uninhabited areas where waste can be disposed of, or fill
them with our refuse until they become uninhabitable. Since a
flourishing society will vigorously exploit its natural resources, it will
produce correspondingly great quantities of trash, and quickly its
uninhabited lands will overflow with waste, threatening to make the
society’s own habitation into a wasteland.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because waste is unveiling, it is not only placed out of sight, it is
declared a kind of antiproperty. No one owns it. Part of the
contradiction in the phenomenon of waste is that treating nature as
though it belongs to us we must soon treat nature as though it belongs
to no one. Not only does no one own waste, no one wants it. Instead of
competing to possess these particular products, we compete to
dispossess them. We force it on others less able to rid themselves of it.
Trash accumulates in slums, sewage runs downstream, airborne acid
drifts hundreds of miles settling on the lands of those powerless to halt
its “disposal” into the atmosphere. Thousands of square miles of farm
lands have been laid waste by the construction of multilane highways, or
submerged by dams whose water is used to flush waste from distant
cities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waste is the antiproperty that becomes the possession of losers. It is
the emblem of the untitled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waste is unveiling, because it persists in showing itself as waste, and
as our waste. If waste is the result of our indifference to nature, it is also
the way we experience the indifference of nature. Waste is therefore a
reminder that society is a species of culture. Looking about at the
wasteland into which we have converted our habitation, we can plainly
see that nature is not whatever we want it to be; but we can also plainly
see that society is only what we want it to be.
It is a consequence of this contradiction that the more waste a society
produces, the more unveiling that waste is, and thus the more vigorously
must a society deny that it produces any waste at all; the more it must
dispose, or hide, or ignore, its detritus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the attempt to control nature is at its heart the attempt to
control other persons, we can expect societies to be less patient with
those cultures which express some degree of indifference to societal
goals and values. It is this repeated parallel that brings us to see that the
society that creates natural waste creates human waste.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waste persons are those no longer useful as resources to a society for
whatever reason, and have become apatrides, or noncitizens. Waste
persons must be placed out of view—in ghettos, slums, reservations,
camps, retirement villages, mass graves, remote territories, strategic
hamlets—all places of desolation, and uninhabitable. We live in a
century whose Master Players have created many millions of such
“superfluous persons” (Rubenstein).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A people does not become superfluous by itself, any more than
natural waste creates itself. It is society that declares some persons to be
waste. Human trash is not an unfortunate burden on a society, an
indirect result of its proper conduct; it is its direct product. European
settlers in the American, African, and Asian continents did not happen
to come upon populations of unwanted persons nature had thrust in
their way; they made them superfluous by way of some of the most
important and irreversible principles of their societies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see nature as genius when we see as genius.
We understand nature as source when we understand ourselves as
source. We abandon all attempts at an explanation of nature when we
see that we cannot be explained, when our own self-origination cannot
be stated as fact. We behold the irreducible otherness of nature when we
behold ourselves as its other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>God did breathe life into us, but in
order to continue living we had to do our own breathing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We stand before genius in silence. We cannot speak it, we can only
speak as it. Yet, though I speak as genius, I cannot speak for genius. I
cannot give nature a voice in my script. I can not give others a voice in
my script—without denying their own source, their originality. To do so
is to cease responding to the other, to cease being responsible. No one
and nothing belong in my script.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MYTH PROVOKES Explanation but accepts none of it. Where explanation
absorbs the unspeakable into the speakable, myth reintroduces the
silence that makes original discourse possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explanations establish islands, even continents, of order and
predictability. But these regions were first charted by adventurers whose
lives are narratives of exploration and risk. They found them only by
mythic journeys into the wayless open. When the less adventuresome
settlers arrive later to work out the details and domesticate these spaces,
they easily lose the sense that all this firm knowledge does not expunge
myth, but floats in it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowledge is what successful explanation has led to; the thinking that
sent us forth, however, is pure story.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Copernicus was a traveler who went with a hundred pairs of eyes,
daring to look again at all that is familiar in the hope of vision. What
we hear in this account is the ancient saga of the solitary wanderer, the
peregrinus, who risks anything for the sake of surprise. True, at a certain
point he stopped to look and may have ended his journey as a Master
Player setting down bounded fact. But what resounds most deeply in
the life of Copernicus is the journey that made knowledge possible and
not the knowledge that made the journey successful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That myth does not accept the explanations it provokes we can see in
the boldness with which thinkers in any territorial endeavor reexamine
the familiar for a higher seeing. Indeed, the very liveliness of a culture is
determined not by how frequently these thinkers discover new
continents of knowledge but by how frequently they depart to seek
them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A story attains the status of myth when it is retold, and persistently
retold, solely for its own sake.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not go out searching for stories for
ourselves; it is rather the stories that have found us for themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stories that have the enduring strength of myths
reach through experience to touch the genius in each of us.
But
experience is the result of this generative touch, not its cause. So far is
this the case that we can even say that if we cannot tell a story about what
happened to us, nothing has happened to us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Storytellers become metaphysicians, or ideologists, when they come
to believe they know the entire story of a people. This is history
theatricalized, with the beginning and end in plain sight. A
psychoanalyst who looks for the Freudian myth in patients imposes a
filter that lets through nothing the psychoanalyst was not prepared to
find.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We resonate with myth when it resounds in us. A myth resounds in
me when its voice is heard in mine but not heard as mine.
I do not
resonate when I quote Jeremiah or when I speak as Jeremiah, but only
when Jeremiah speaks in a way that touches an original voice in me</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resonance of myth collapses the apparent distinction between
the story told by one person to another and the story of their telling and
listening</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one thing for you to tell me the story of Muhammad; it is
quite another for me to tell the story of your telling me about
Muhammad. Ordinarily we confine the story to the words of the
speaker. But in doing so we treat it as a story quoted, not a story told.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gospel can be heard nowhere except from those who themselves</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even when it is God who is heard by
the prophet, it is a god who speaks in the language and idiom of the
prophet, and not in locutions restricted to divine utterance—as though
that god’s speaking were itself a form of listening.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, myth is the highest form of our listening to each other, of
offering a silence that makes the speech of the other possible. This is
why listening is far more valued by religion than speaking. Fides ex
auditu. Faith comes by listening, Paul said.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opposite of resonance is amplification. A choir is the unified
expression of voices resonating with each other; a loudspeaker is the
amplification of a single voice, excluding all others. A bell resonates, a
cannon amplifies. We listen to the bell, we are silenced by the cannon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a single voice is sufficiently amplified, it becomes a speaking
that makes it impossible for any other voices to be heard. We do not
listen to a loudspeaker for what is being said, but only because it is all
that is being said.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Magisterial speech is amplified speech; it is speechthat silences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amplified voice seeks obedient action on the part of its
hearers and an immediate end to their speech. There is no possibility of
conversation with a loudspeaker.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ideology is the amplification of myth. It is the assumption that since
the beginning and end of history are known there is nothing more to
say. History is therefore to be obediently lived out according to the
ideology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What ideologists are concerned to hide is the choral nature of
history, the sense that it is a symphony of very different, even opposed,
voices, each nonetheless making the other possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is true that myth provokes explanation, then it is also true that
explanation’s ultimate design is to eliminate myth. It is not just that the
availability of bells in churches and town halls of Europe makes it
possible to forge new cannon; it is that the cannon are forged in order to
silence the bells.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The loudspeaker, successfully muting all other voices and therefore
all possibility of conversation, is not listened to at all, and for that
reason loses its own voice and becomes mere noise. Whenever we
succeed in being the only speaker, there is no speaker at all</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Julius
Caesar originally sought power in Rome because he loved to play the
very dangerous style of politics common to the Republic; but he played
the game so well that he destroyed all his opponents, making it
impossible for him to find genuinely dangerous combat. He was unable
to do the very thing for which he sought power. His word was now
irresistible, and for that reason he could speak with no one, and hisisolation was complete.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to say that all explanation is meant to silence myth itself,
then it will follow that whenever we find people deeply committed to
explanation and ideology, whenever play takes on the seriousness of
warfare, we will find persons troubled by myths they cannot forget they
have forgotten. The myths that cannot be forgotten are those so
resonant with the paradox of silence they become the source of our
thinking, even our culture, and our civilization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The myth of Jesus is exemplary, but not necessary. No myth is
necessary. There is no story that must be told. Stories do not have a
truth that someone needs to reveal, or someone needs to hear. It is part
of the myth of Jesus that it makes itself unnecessary; it is a narrative of
the word becoming flesh, of language entering history; a narrative of the
word becoming flesh and dying, of history entering language. Who
listens to his myth cannot rise above history to utter timeless truths
about it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not necessary for infinite players to be Christians; indeed it is not
possible for them to be Christians—seriously. Neither is it possible for
them to be Buddhists, or Muslims, or atheists, or New Yorkers—
seriously. All such titles can only be playful abstractions, mere
performances for the sake of laughter.
Infinite players are not serious actors in any story, but the joyful
poets of a story that continues to originate what they cannot finish.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There was something rather confusing about the definition of birth. birth is accurately defined but then used as exchange or emerged or concieved.</li>
  <li>difference of looking and seeing</li>
  <li>difference of touching and moving</li>
  <li>freedom leads to more time or more time leads to more freedom</li>
  <li>
    <p>“To believe is to know you believe, and to know you believe is not to believe” (Sartre).
It merely means that you should play with your heart fully devoted yet you should also be aware that you’re just playing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If the silence of nature is the possibility of language, language is the
possibility of history ????</li>
</ul>

<p>Final words:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s sometimes really difficult to understand it. I had to red several times to understand the point, but then little by little I got used to it and begun to love it :)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The part that speaks about machines it sounds a bit off</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe I have to read the last 3 chapters again</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall you’re an infinite player playing finite games but you’re aware of it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth- shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really
need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you
solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In
order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems
level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal,
then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals- first mentality is that
you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, goals create an “either- or” conflict: either you achieve
your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.
You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is
misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match
the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense
to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths
to success.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A systems- first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in
love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to
give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime
your system is running.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to
push you forward after you achieve it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of
building systems is to continue playing the game. True long- term
thinking is goal- less thinking. It’s not about any single
accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and
continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the
process that will determine your progress</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your
systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental
unit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny
routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel
bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of
their initial investment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Habits are the compound interest of self- improvement. Getting 1
percent better every day counts for a lot in the long- run.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habits are a double- edged sword. They can work for you or
against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross
a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any
compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just
as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are
the building blocks of remarkable results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus
on your system instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of
your systems.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="season02">Season02</h1>
<p>How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (andVice Versa)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few
days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation.
Habits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are
reasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to
change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the
wrong way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your
outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With outcome- based habits, the focus is on what you want to
achieve. With identity- based habits, the focus is on who you wish to
become.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. The system of
a democracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and
social equality. The system of a dictatorship has a very different set of
beliefs like absolute authority and strict obedience. You can imagine
many ways to try to get more people to vote in a democracy, but such
behavior change would never get off the ground in a dictatorship.
That’s not the identity of the system. Voting is a behavior that is
impossible under a certain set of beliefs.
(means if you don’t change your identity you can’t change some behaviors)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may
want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes
rather than creates, then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending
rather than earning. You may want better health, but if you continue to
prioritize comfort over accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing
rather than training. It’s hard to change your habits if you never
change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes
part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who
wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person
who is this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the
more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit
because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that
it becomes part of your identity</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.
The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Doing the right thing is
easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned,
you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like
the type of person you already believe yourself to be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have adopted an identity, it can be
easy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change. Many
people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the
norms attached to their identity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In time, you begin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” There is
internal pressure to maintain your self- image and behave in a way that
is consistent with your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid
contradicting yourself.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to
slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you
begin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” There is
internal pressure to maintain your self- image and behave in a way that
is consistent with your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid
contradicting yourself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with
your identity, you will fail to put them into action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re
too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons.
Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits
is that your self- image gets in the way</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit
your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset
beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and
conditioned through experience.*</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity
associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally
derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and
identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your
“repeated beingness.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you
have proof of it. If you go to church every Sunday for twenty years, you
have evidence that you are religious. If you study biology for one hour
every night, you have evidence that you are studious. If you go to the
gym even when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are committed
to fitness. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly
you will believe it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each experience in life modifies your self- image, but
it’s unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you
kicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you
repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self- 
image begins to change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our
fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit,
day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing
microevolutions of the self.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Small habits
can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new
identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the
paradox of making small improvements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to
changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are
is to change what you do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>It is a simple two- step process:
    <ol>
      <li>Decide the type of person you want to be.</li>
      <li>Prove it to yourself with small wins.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two- way
street. The formation of all habits is a feedback loop, but it’s important to let your
values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results.
The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not
getting a particular outcome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first step is not
what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be.
Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. And
that’s why we are starting here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Habits can help you achieve all of
these things, but fundamentally they are not about having something.
They are about becoming someone.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change,
and identity change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on
what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for
the type of person you wish to become.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to
continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your
identity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you
better results (although they can do that), but because they can
change your beliefs about yourself.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become
automatic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn,
try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and
the useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to
automate the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series of
automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face
regularly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a
habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a
problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw
on this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The
primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what
will work in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is
the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at
a time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habits reduce cognitive load and free up
mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of
life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges
and master the next set of problems. Building habits in the present
allows you to do more of what you want in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps:
cue, craving, response, and reward</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external
environment for hints of where rewards are located. Because the cue is
the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a
craving.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force
behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—
without craving a change—we have no reason to act.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What you crave is
not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave
smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted.
The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what
transform a cue into a craving.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you
perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a
response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much
friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires
more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you
won’t do it. Your response also depends on your ability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of
every habit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wechase rewards because they serve two purposes:
(1) they satisfy us and
(2) they teach us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not
become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start.
Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to
act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if
the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do
it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not
occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase
and the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the
craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when
you take action and achieve the change you desire.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes
the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain
it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you
want to relieve it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to create a good habbit:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.
The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.
The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.
The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.</p>

<p>The Man Who Didn’t Look Right</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you
don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an
opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to
it. This is what makes habits useful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions
come under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind.
You fall into old patterns before you realize what’s happening.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle
on our current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds
because once a habit is firmly rooted in your life</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a habit remains mindless, you can’t
expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you
make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will
call it fate.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to
consciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a
thousand times before, we begin to overlook things. We assume that
the next time will be just like the last</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining
awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the
consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular
habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior help me
become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for
or against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired
identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired
identity are usually bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for
them. If you feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing- 
and- Calling in your own life. Say out loud the action that you are
thinking of taking and what the outcome will be</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences
seem more real. It adds weight to the action rather than letting
yourself mindlessly slip into an old routine. This approach is useful
even if you’re simply trying to remember a task on your to- do list</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The process of behavior change always starts with awareness.
Strategies like Pointing- and- Calling and the Habits Scorecard are
focused on getting you to recognize your habits and acknowledge the
cues that trigger them, which makes it possible to respond in a way
that benefits you.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>summary</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that
predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to
what we are doing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You
need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pointing- and- Calling raises your level of awareness from a
nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your
actions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become
more aware of your behavior.</p>

<p>The Best Way to Start a New Habit</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the
feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip
cookies, the sound of ambulance sirens—but the two most common
cues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of
these cues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation
intention is:
“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when
and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow
through.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack
is clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some
people spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make
an improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill
out this sentence:
I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say
no to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you
off course. We often say yes to little requests because we are not clear
enough about what we need to be doing instead. When your dreams
are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never
get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world
The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition,
you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t
say why.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No behavior happens in
isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the best ways to
build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day
and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention.
Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location,
you pair it with a current habit. This method, which was created by BJ
Fogg as part of his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design an
obvious cue for nearly any habit.*
The habit stacking formula is:
“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already
do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can
begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your current
routines. For example, you may already have a morning routine that
looks like this: Wake up &gt; Make my bed &gt; Take a shower. Let’s say you
want to develop the habit of reading more each night. You can expand
your habit stack and try something like: Wake up &gt; Make my bed &gt;
Place a book on my pillow &gt; Take a shower. Now, when you climb into
bed each night, a book will be sitting there waiting for you to enjoy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a
successful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off.
Unlike an implementation intention, which specifically states the time
and location for a given behavior, habit stacking implicitly has the time
and location built into it. When and where you choose to insert a habit
into your daily routine can make a big difference</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied with
something else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy causes, but these
goals do not provide instruction on how and when to act. Be specific
and clear: After I close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit
down at the table. The specificity is important.</p>

<p>Motivation Is Overrated; EnvironmentOften Matters More</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>People often choose products not because of what they are, but
because of where they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of
cookies on the counter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if
I hadn’t been thinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily
feel hungry</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that
makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in
their Environment, or B = f (P,E).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense, it
should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of
our behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead
to a big shift in what you do. As a result, you can imagine how
important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with
productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice
cues that stand out. Unfortunately, the environments where we live
and work often make it easy not to do certain actions because there is
no obvious cue to trigger the behavior</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big
part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have
multiple cues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how
we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people
live in a world others have created for them. But you can alter the
spaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive
cues and reduce your exposure to negative ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time
your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the
entire context surrounding the behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by
our relationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about the
influence of the environment on your behavior. Stop thinking about
your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled
with relationships.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can
be easier to change in a new environment. It helps to escape the subtle
triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a
new place—a different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of
your room you seldom use—and create a new routine there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>avoid mixing the context of one habit with
another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—
and the easier ones will usually win out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is
an environment where habits can easily form</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior
over time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues
that stand out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger
but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context
becomes the cue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you
are not fighting against old cues.</p>

<p>The Secret to Self- Control</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>people who appear to have tremendous self- control,
it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who
are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring
their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self- 
control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the
feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because
you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel
sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the
energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel
anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes
your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more anxious. It’s a
downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to
forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your
brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go
unused for quite a while.And that means that simply resisting
temptation is an ineffective strategy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce
exposure to the cue that causes it</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in
another room for a few hours.</p>

<p>If you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop following
social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.</p>

<p>If you’re wasting too much time watching television, move the TV
out of the bedroom.</p>

<p>If you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit reading
reviews of the latest tech gear.</p>

<p>If you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and
put it in a closet after each use.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can
muster the willpower to override your desires every time</li>
</ul>

<p>How to Make a Habit Irresistible</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules for
behavior, and when it comes across an exaggerated version of that rule,
it lights up like a Christmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggerated
cues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened
version of reality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a
volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the future will be
more attractive than those of today. The trend is for rewards to become
more concentrated and stimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is a
more concentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard liquor is a
more concentrated form of alcohol than beer. Video games are a moreconcentrated form of play than board games.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you
need to make it attractive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can
make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by
understanding what a craving is and how it works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habits are a dopamine- driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is
highly habit- forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video
games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of
dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors
like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but
now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes,
including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion,
and voluntary movement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is
released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you
anticipate it.Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before
they place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of
dopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of
dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does
your motivation to act.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets
us to take action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when
you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you
anticipate a reward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting
rewards than for liking them.By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much
smaller.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the
regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of
the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives
behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that
precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior
Change. We need to make our habits attractive because it is the
expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the
first place. This is where a strategy known as temptation bundling
comes into play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Temptation bundling works by linking an action
you want to do with an action you need to do</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory
known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor
David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will
reinforce less probable behaviors.” In other words, even if you don’t
really want to process overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned
to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along
the way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].</li>
      <li>After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].</li>
    </ol>

<p>The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A genius is not born, but is educated and trained.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We follow the
script handed down by our friends and family, our church or school,
our local community and society at large. Each of these cultures and
groups comes with its own set of expectations and standards—when
and whether to get married, how many children to have, which
holidays to celebrate, how much money to spend on your child’s
birthday party. In many ways, these social norms are the invisible rules
that guide your behavior each day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the time, going along with the group does not feel like a
burden. Everyone wants to belong. If you grow up in a family that
rewards you for your chess skills, playing chess will seem like a very
attractive thing to do. If you work in a job where everyone wears
expensive suits, then you’ll be inclined to splurge on one as well. If all
of your friends are sharing an inside joke or using a new phrase, you’ll
want to do it, too, so they know that you “get it.” Behaviors are
attractive when they help us fit in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:
    <ol>
      <li>The close.</li>
      <li>The many.</li>
      <li>The powerful.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we
are to imitate some of their habits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is
to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise
together</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It
transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on
your own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a
musician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a
cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We are readers.
We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to
reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group
after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s
friendship and community that embed a new identity and help
behaviors last over the long run.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide
our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and
wondering, “What is everyone else doing?” We check reviews on
Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best”
buying, eating, and travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy. There is
evidence in numbers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired
behavior of the individual</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is tremendous internal pressure to
comply with the norms of the group. The reward of being accepted is
often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart,
or finding truth. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than
be right by ourselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is
unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the
tribe, change is very attractive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High- status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others.
And that means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise,
we find it attractive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The sisters practiced chess for
many hours each day and continued this remarkable effort for decades.
But these habits and behaviors maintained their attractiveness, in part,
because they were valued by their culture. From the praise of theirparents to the achievement of different status markers like becoming a
grandmaster, they had many reasons to continue their effort.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive
to us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our
culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the
tribe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close
(family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those
with status and prestige).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits
is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal
behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the
group.</p>

<p>How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying
motive. Your brain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes or
to check Instagram or to play video games. At a deep level, you simply
want to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, to win social
acceptance and approval, or to achieve status.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your habits are modern- day solutions to ancient desires. New
versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior
remain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the
period of history.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here’s the powerful part: there are many different ways to address
the same underlying motive. One person might learn to reduce stress
by smoking a cigarette. Another person learns to ease their anxiety by
going for a run. Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to
solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to
use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve,
you keep coming back to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habits are all about associations. These associations determine
whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you are making your
best guess of how to act given what you’ve just seen and what has
worked for you in the past. You are endlessly predicting what will
happen in the next moment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two people can look at the same cigarette, and one feels
the urge to smoke while the other is repulsed by the smell. The same
cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your
prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that
precedes them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically
describe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Feelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a
signal that we can apply.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to
change your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap
between what your body is currently sensing and what it wants to be
sensing. This gap between your current state and your desired state
provides a reason to act.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you
want to be in the future. Even the tiniest action is tinged with the
motivation to feel differently than you do in the moment. When you
binge- eat or light up or browse social media, what you really want is
not a potato chip or a cigarette or a bunch of likes. What you really
want is to feel different.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a
craving to do it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking social
media will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you
to forget your fears. Habits are attractive when we associate them with
positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather
than to our detriment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate
them with a positive experience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their
drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and
make a habit seem more attractive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to
reframe the associations you have about them. It’s not easy, but if you
can reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit into
an attractive one.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it
unattractive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper
underlying motive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your habits are modern- day solutions to ancient desires.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes
them. The prediction leads to a feeling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem
unattractive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive
feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative
feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy
immediately before a difficult habit.</p>

<p>Walk Slowly, but Never Backward</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for
change:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build
muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring
out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As
Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking
action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When
you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those
are all good things, but they don’t produce a result.
Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an
outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s
motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that’s action. If I
search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that’s
motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If motion doesn’t lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do
it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than
not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making
progress without running the risk of failure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really,
you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation
becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You
don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not
perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You
just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you
just need to get your reps in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes
progressively more automatic through repetition. The more you repeat
an activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become
efficient at that activity. Neuroscientists call this long- term
potentiation, which refers to the strengthening of connections between
neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular
neural circuit associated with that habit. This means that simply
putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to
automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is
the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step,
which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>habits form based on frequency, not time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take
to build a new habit?” But what people really should be asking is, “How
many does it take to form a new habit?” That is, how many repetitions
are required to make a habit automatic?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your current habits have been internalized over the course of hundreds, if
not thousands, of repetitions. New habits require the same level of
frequency. You need to string together enough successful attempts
until the behavior is firmly embedded in your mind and you cross the
Habit Line.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practice, it doesn’t really matter how long it takes for a habit to
become automatic. What matters is that you take the actions you need
to take to make progress. Whether an action is fully automatic is of less
importance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective way
to make practice happen is to adhere to the 3rd Law of Behavior
Change: make it easy</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.</p>

<p>The Law of Least Effort</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Conventional wisdom holds that
motivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if you really wanted it,
you’d actually do it. But the truth is, our real motivation is to be lazy
and to do what is convenient. And despite what the latest productivity
best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every action requires a certain amount of energy. The more energy
required, the less likely it is to occur</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really
want. Dieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to
feeling calm. Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly. You don’t
actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the
habit delivers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greater the obstacle—that is, the more difficult the
habit—the more friction there is between you and your desired end
state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you can make your good habits more convenient, you’ll be more likely to follow through on them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea behind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as
possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we discussed environment design as a method for making cues more
obvious, but you can also optimize your environment to make actions
easier</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right
thing is as easy as possible. Much of the battle of building better habits
comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our
good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the
actions that are easiest to do.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>

gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of
work.</p>

<p>How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two- Minute Rule</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Habits are automatic choices that influence the conscious decisions that follow. Yes, a habit can be completed in just a few seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you take for minutes
or hours afterward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing
than to start doing something different.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decisive moments set the options available to your future self</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why mastering
the decisive moments throughout your day is so important. Each day is
made up of many moments, but it is really a few habitual choices that
determine the path you take. These little choices stack up, each one
setting the trajectory for how you spend the next chunk of time.Habits 
are the entry point, not the end point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even when you know you should start small, it’s easy to start too big.
When you dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes
over and you end up trying to do too much too soon.The most effective
way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two- Minute Rule,
which states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two
minutes to do.”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two- 
minute version:
“Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.”
“Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.”
“Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”
“Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.”
“Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>once you’ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The
actions that follow can be challenging, but the first two minutes should
be easy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If you
can’t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of
mastering the finer details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By developing a consistent
power- down habit, you make it easier to get to bed at a reasonable time
each night. You may not be able to automate the whole process, but
you can make the first action mindless. Make it easy to start and the
rest will follow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first two minutes should
be easy. What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally leads you
down a more productive path.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your
desired outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from “very easy”
to “very hard.” For instance, running a marathon is very hard. Running
a 5K is hard. Walking ten thousand steps is moderately difficult.
Walking ten minutes is easy. And putting on your running shoes is very
easy. Your goal might be to run a marathon, but your gateway habit is
to put on your running shoes. That’s how you follow the Two- Minute
Rule</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit
from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have
to standardize before you can optimize.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply
become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is not merely
a hack to make habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a
difficult skill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Journaling provides another example. Nearly everyone can benefit
from getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper, but most
people give up after a few days or avoid it entirely because journaling
feels like a chore.* The secret is to always stay below the point where it
feels like work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the
identity you want to build.If you show up at the gym five days in a row
—even if it’s just for two minutes—you are casting votes for your new
identity. You’re not worried about getting in shape. You’re focused on
becoming the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts. You’re taking
the smallest action that confirms the type of person you want to be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We rarely think about change this way because everyone is
consumed by the end goal. But one push- up is better than not
exercising. One minute of guitar practice is better than none at all. One
minute of reading is better than never picking up a book. It’s better to
do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing
up each day, you can combine the Two- Minute Rule with a technique
we call habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate
goal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever you are struggling to stick with a habit, you can employ
the Two- Minute Rule. It’s a simple way to make your habits easy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact
your behavior for minutes or hours afterward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a
fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of aproductive day or an unproductive one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Two- Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it
should take less than two minutes to do.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely
it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is
required to do great things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that
doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more
about making bad habits hard.This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of
Behavior Change: make it difficult.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that
controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future
behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get
out of the good habit than to get started on it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing
in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present. However,
we can do even better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sleep on a mattress(mattress: a cloth case that is filled with material and used as a bed)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many ways to automate good habits and
eliminate bad ones. Typically, they involve putting technology to work
for you. Technology can transform actions that were once hard,
annoying, and complicated into behaviors that are easy, painless, and
simple. It is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right
behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend
your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit that we
hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to
pour into the next stage of growth</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping
from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but
ultimately more rewarding, work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When working in your favor, automation can make your good habits
inevitable and your bad habits impossible. It is the ultimate way to lock
in future behavior rather than relying on willpower in the moment. By
utilizing commitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and
technology, you can create an environment of inevitability—a space
where good habits are not just an outcome you hope for but an
outcome that is virtually guaranteed.</p>

<h1 id="season15">Season15</h1>
<p>The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is
satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor
ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers
well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again,
next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth
remembering and repeating.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Positive emotions
cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth law of behavior change—make it
satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next
time. It completes the habit loop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type of
satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’d be an animal then You are constantly focused on the
present or the very near future. You live in what scientists call an
immediate- return environment because your actions instantly deliver
clear and immediate outcomes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Human live in what scientists call a delayed- return environment because you
can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After thousands of generations in an immediate- return environment, our
brains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to long- term ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You value the present more than the future. Usually, this
tendency serves us well. A reward that is certain right now is typically
worth more than one that is merely possible in the future. But
occasionally, our bias toward instant gratification causes problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you understand how
the brain prioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the
consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are
immediate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately,
these outcomes are often misaligned. With our bad habits, the
immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels
bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is
unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It almost always happens that when the immediate
consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and
vice versa. . . . Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more
bitter are its later fruits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you
can’t rely on good intentions. When you make a plan—to lose weight,
write a book, or learn a language—you are actually making plans for
your future self</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all want better lives for our future selves. However, when the
moment of decision arrives, instant gratification usually wins. You are
no longer making a choice for Future You, who dreams of being fitter
or wealthier or happier.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a general rule, the more
immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you
should question whether it aligns with your long- term goals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is
immediately punished is avoided.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth
about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all
day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road
of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll
face less competition and often get a bigger payoff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At some point, success in nearly every field requires you to
ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s possible to train yourself
to delay gratification—but you need to work with the grain of humannature, not against it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of
immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long- run and a
little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if
it’s in a small way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid
off and that the work was worth the effort.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the beginning, you need a reason to stay
on track. This is why immediate rewards are essential. They keep you
excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the background.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ending of any
experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other
phases. You want the ending of your habit to be satisfying. The best
approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using
an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reinforcement ties your habit to
an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing
with habits of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be hard to feel
satisfied when there is no action in the first place. All you’re doing is
resisting temptation, and there isn’t much satisfying about that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make
avoidance visible. Open a savings account and label it for something
you want—maybe “Leather Jacket.” Whenever you pass on a purchase,
put the same amount of money in the account</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth noting that it is important to select short- term rewards
that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy,
and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing
the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You
do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits
of reinforcement—like soap that smells great or toothpaste that has a
refreshing mint flavor or seeing $50 hit your savings account—can
offer the immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is
easy when it is enjoyable.</p>

<p>How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving
paper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your
progress. As a result, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of
immediate satisfaction to any activity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages
multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior
obvious, attractive, and satisfying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next
one. Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the
streak of X’s on your calendar or the list of meals in your food log.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted
view of our own behavior. We think we act better than we do.
Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own
behavior and notice what’s really going on each day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a
signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to
continue down that path. In this way, habit tracking can have an
addictive effect on motivation. Each small win feeds your desire.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tracking can become its own
form of reward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to- do list, to
complete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an X on the
calendar. It feels good to watch your results grow</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused
on the process rather than the result.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind
you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress
you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying
whenever you record another successful instance of your habit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting
votes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful
form of immediate and intrinsic gratification</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That said, every habit streak ends at some point. And, more
important than any single measurement, is having a good plan for
when your habits slide off track.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that
life will interrupt you at some point</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of
repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing
twice is the start of a new habit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone
can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But
when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a
habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Too often, we fall
into an all- or- nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not
slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something
perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or
busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it
reaffirms your identity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The all- or- nothing cycle of behavior change is just one pitfall that
can derail your habits. Another potential danger—especially if you areusing a habit tracker—is measuring the wrong thing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a measure
becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure
Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not
when it consumes you</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make
your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of yourprogress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.</p>

<p>How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then
adding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their odds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that
makes them hard to abandon. The best way I know to overcome this
predicament is to increase the speed of the punishment associated with
the behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as actions incur an immediate consequence, behavior
begins to change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, of course, a limit to this. If you’re going to rely on
punishment to change behavior, then the strength of the punishment
must match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be productive, the cost of procrastination must be greater than the
cost of action. To be healthy, the cost of laziness must be greater than
the cost of exercise</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the
consequence, the more likely it is to influence individual behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can
create a habit contract to hold yourself accountable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A habit contract is
a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a
particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow
through.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make them
painful in the moment. Creating a habit contract is a straightforward
way to do exactly that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing that
someone is watching can be a powerful motivator. You are less likely to
procrastinate or give up because there is an immediate cost. If you
don’t follow through, perhaps they’ll see you as untrustworthy or lazy.
Suddenly, you are not only failing to uphold your promises to yourself,
but also failing to uphold your promises to others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are always trying to present our best selves to the world. We
comb our hair and brush our teeth and dress ourselves carefully
because we know these habits are likely to get a positive reaction. We
want to get good grades and graduate from top schools to impress
potential employers and mates and our friends and family. We care
about the opinions of those around us because it helps if others like us.
This is precisely why getting an accountability partner or signing a
habit contract can work so well.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it
unsatisfying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or
unsatisfying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to
inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do
not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior.
It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful
motivator.</p>

<p>The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right
field of competition</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying
to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and
abilities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our environment determines the
suitability of our genes and the utility of our natural talents. When our
environment changes, so do the qualities that determine success.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Competence is highly dependent on context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people at the top of any competitive field are not only well
trained, they are also well suited to the task. And this is why, if you
want to be truly great, selecting the right place to focus is crucial.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short: genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your
areas of opportunity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key is to direct your effort toward areas that
both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition
with your ability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The takeaway is that you should build habits that work for your
personality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and
satisfaction. Find it. Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going to
stick. This is the core idea behind the 4th Law.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for
maintaining motivation and feeling successful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In theory, you can
enjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the
things that come easily to you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They stay energized because they are making
progress where others have failed, and because they get rewarded with
better pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them
happier but also propels them to produce even higher- quality work. It’s
a virtuous cycle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and
life is a struggle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the long- run, if you continue to
advance and improve, any area can become challenging. At some
point, you need to make sure you’re playing the right game for your
skillset. How do you figure that out?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the long- run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy
that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the
time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it butwhether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most
people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is
the work you were made to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This blend of happiness and peak
performance is what athletes and performers experience when
they are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a flow
state and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a
behavior is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in
our favor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When have I felt alive? When have I felt like
the real me?” No internal judgments or people- pleasing. No
second- guessing or self- criticism. Just feelings of engagement and
enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are
headed in the right direction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you can’t find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor,
create one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if you’re not the most naturally gifted, you can often win
by being the best in a very narrow category.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it.
They tell us what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we
know where to spend our time and energy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Biological differences matter. Even so, it’s more productive to focus
on whether you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing
yourself to someone else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that you have a natural limit to any
specific ability has nothing to do with whether you are reaching the
ceiling of your capabilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, genes can’t make you successful if you’re not doing
the work. Yes, it’s possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has better
genes, but if you haven’t put in the same reps, it’s impossible to say if
you have been dealt a better or worse genetic hand</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain
satisfying over the long- run is to pick behaviors that align with your
personality and skills</p>

<p>The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just
manageable difficulty.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an
optimal zone of difficulty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation
when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current
abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep the
behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when
conditions aren’t perfect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A flow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and fully
immersed in an activity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4
percent beyond your current ability. In real life it’s typically not
feasible to quantify the difficulty of an action in this way, but the core
idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just
manageable difficulty—something on the perimeter of your ability—
seems crucial for maintaining motivation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly
search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to
make enough progress to stay motivated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Behaviors need to remain
novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without
variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on
the quest for self- improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At some point it comes
down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the
same lifts over and over and over</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of us get depressed when we lose focus or
motivation because we think that successful people have some
bottomless reserve of passion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The
difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of
boredom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the
more boring and routine it becomes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the beginner gains have
been made and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome
becomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start
derailing our progress to seek novelty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as we
experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new
strategy—even if the old one was still working.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well
wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A gambler hits the jackpot
every now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of
rewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine,
enhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Variable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a
reward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval,
and hope it will change their mind—but they are a powerful way to
amplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce
boredom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and
failure. Half of the time you get what you want. Half of the time you
don’t</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You need just enough “winning” to experience satisfaction and
just enough “wanting” to experience desire.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re already interested in a habit,
working on challenges of just manageable difficulty is a good way to
keep things interesting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Variable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At
some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self- 
improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we
would like to fulfill, but it doesn’t matter what you are trying to become
better at, if you only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then
you’ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking
to it, there will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a
business, there will be days when you don’t feel like showing up. When
you’re at the gym, there will be sets that you don’t feel like finishing.
When it’s time to write, there will be days that you don’t feel like
typing. But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do
so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an
amateur.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>David Cain, an author and meditation teacher, encourages his
students to avoid being “fair- weather meditators.” Similarly, you don’t
want to be a fair- weather athlete or a fair- weather writer or a fair- 
weather anything. When a habit is truly important to you, you have to
be willing to stick to it in any mood.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by
doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with
boredom.</p>

<p>The Downside of Creating Good Habits</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When you know the simple movements so well that you can perform them without
thinking, you are free to pay attention to more advanced details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall
into mindless repetition. It becomes easier to let mistakes slide. When
you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how
to do it better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The
downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way
and stop paying attention to little errors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Usually, this minor dip in performance is no cause for worry. You
don’t need a system to continuously improve how well you brush your
teeth or tie your shoes or make your morning cup of tea</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when you want to maximize your potential and achieve
elite levels of performance, you need a more nuanced approach</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, when you want to maximize your potential and achieve
elite levels of performance, you need a more nuanced approach. You
can’t repeat the same things blindly and expect to become exceptional.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What you need is a combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice.
Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of
success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then
using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier
of your development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each habit unlocks the next level of
performance. It’s an endless cycle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain
conscious of your performance over time, so you can continue to refine
and improve.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like
you have mastered a skill—right when things are starting to feelautomatic and you are becoming comfortable—that you must avoid
slipping into the trap of complacency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way to be successful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same
way every time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reflection and review enables the long- term improvement of all
habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you
consider possible paths for improvement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without reflection, we can
make excuses, create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no
process for determining whether we are performing better or worse
compared to yesterday.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improvement is not just about learning habits, it’s also about fine- 
tuning them. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time
on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary—
like Pat Riley adjusting the effort of his players on a nightly basis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are
powerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about
every daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch
away. You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the bigger
picture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Periodic reflection and review is like viewing
yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. You can see the
important changes you should make without losing sight of the bigger
picture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of
the most important aspects of behavior change: identity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you latch on to that new identity, however,
those same beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth.
When working against you, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that
encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly
growing. This is one of the greatest downsides of building habits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes
to grow beyond it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more you let a single belief
define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges
you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you cling too tightly to one identity, you become brittle.
Lose that one thing and you lose yourself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Military veterans and former entrepreneurs report similar feelings.
If your identity is wrapped up in a belief like “I’m a great soldier,” what
happens when your period of service ends? For many business owners,
their identity is something along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the
founder.” If you have spent every waking moment working on your
business, how will you feel after you sell the company?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself
such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if
your particular role changes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When chosen effectively, an identity can be flexible rather than
brittle. Like water flowing around an obstacle, your identity works with
the changing circumstances rather than against them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can
lock us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when
the world is shifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is
constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your
old habits and beliefs are still serving you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lack of self- awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the
antidote.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.
Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain
conscious of your performance over time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow
beyond it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system
to improve, an endless process to refine</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making
improvements. It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop</p>
  </li>

<p>“I cannot forgive your eyes that saw Faputa and her siblings as nothing more than appetizing. Your mouths that use the same words and  prayers as  mother, Those mouths I cannot forgive. I cannot forgive your shapes that continue to blaspheme mother with your being. Your lives that continue to exist, I cannot forgive.</p>

<p>Your intentions, I cannot forgive. Nor your joy, nor your grief, nor your deeds. I absolutely will not allow them to continue. Until you’re all reduced to ashes, I cannot permiss your existence. Everything I was born not to forget, for this day, for this moment. How I tired of waiting. The time I have waited also cannot be forgiven. I will exterminate all of you.”</p>

<p>Here is what Gemini replied with:</p>

<p>”
You defile the air with your putrid breaths, the same air Mother once blessed. You dare walk the earth that cradled her form, your feet sullying the very ground where she lay.  Your blood, a grotesque mockery of the ichor that flowed through her veins, pulsates in vessels that should have been ripped from your flesh long ago.</p>

<p>I despise the dreams that fester in your hollow minds, dreams that will never know the warmth of Mother’s love.  The memories you cling to, the ones that bring you fleeting moments of pleasure or sorrow, are nothing but a pathetic insult to the eternity I have endured.  They are but dust compared to the mountains of loathing that burden my soul.</p>

<p>You cling to life like parasites, sucking the very essence from the world Mother toiled to create.  Each beat of your hearts is a theft, each gasp of breath a violation.  With every sunrise you witness, you spit in the face of her sacrifice.  This existence you so desperately crave, I will tear from you piece by agonizing piece.</p>

<p>Let your screams echo through the abyss, a testament to the depths of my hatred.  Let your final moments be filled not with fear, but with the crushing realization of your insignificance.  For I am the embodiment of Mother’s wrath, and you… you are nothing but ashes waiting to be scattered.</p>

<p>”</p>

<p>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have found increasing attention in various applications, such as remote sensing, surveillance, and disaster management. Unlike optical sensors, SAR can capture images in any weather conditions at any time, making it particularly valuable. However, it poses unique challenges for image
processing tasks, like complex speckle noise, texture, and geometric distortions. For many image processing tasks such as image registration; feature detection and extraction are critical initial steps. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based method for detecting and describing keypoints in SAR images, which can be
specifically applied to SAR image registration tasks. To address the challenges of SAR images, we utilize the R2D2 network and propose a training scheme specifically tailored for these images. Furthermore, our approach involves multiple descriptors utilization for outlier removal between image keypoints and a two-stage pipeline
consisting of coarse and fine stages for robust feature point matching of SAR images. By leveraging the coarse registration stage, which maintains robustness, and also a fine stage that employs multiple descriptors along with a local search technique, our approach enhances the keypoint matching accuracy. Evaluation results show
that the proposed method outperforms most of the traditional and deep learning-based methods in terms of the percentage of correct matches, while achieving comparable or even better root mean squared error (RMSE) results.</p>

<p>First, we are told from childhood that everything we want to do is impossible. As we grow older, layers of prejudice, fear, and guilt accumulate, burying our personal calling deep within our soul. But it is still there. To disinter our dream, we need courage.</p>

<p>Second, we fear hurting those we love by abandoning everything to pursue our dream. But love is a stimulus, not a hindrance. Those who genuinely wish us well want us to be happy and will accompany us on our journey.</p>

<p>Third, we fear the defeats we will encounter on the path to our dream. We suffer more when it doesn’t work out because we cannot fall back on the old excuse that we didn’t really want it anyway. We must have patience and know that the Universe is conspiring in our favor.</p>

<p>Fourth, we fear realizing our dream. The mere possibility of getting what we want fills us with guilt. We forget about the obstacles we overcame, the suffering we endured, and the things we had to give up to get this far. We must believe ourselves worthy of the thing we fought so hard to get.</p>

<p>Living our personal calling is important because once we overcome the obstacles and fulfill our dream, we are filled with a greater sense of euphoria and confidence. We start to live with enthusiasm and pleasure. Unexpected suffering passes more quickly than suffering that is apparently bearable.</p>

<p>In the end, we become an instrument of God, helping the Soul of the World, and understanding why we are here. The secret of life is to fall seven times and get up eight times. Each day and each hour is part of the good fight.</p>
